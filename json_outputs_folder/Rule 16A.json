The amicus had raised a constitutional issue mero motu. That was contrary to the unambiguous language of rule 16A 7 and, consequently, the admission was refused by the court.",

The appellant propounded another interpretation which, according to it, was one which best vindicated the relevant constitutional imperatives. Subsequently, the parties reached a settlement agreement which, despite objections by the appellant, was made an order of court by the court a quo. At this point Corruption Watch, the other amicus curiae, exited the scene. Unhappy with the order, the appellant brought an application for leave to appeal which was unsuccessful. It then obtained the leave of the Supreme Court of Appeal to appeal against the order. On appeal in the latter court it sought to broaden the scope of its challenge to one that was not foreshadowed at all in its application to be admitted as an amicus 9 curiae, or at all by the parties. The Supreme Court of Appeal, in dismissing the appeal, held:",

As pointed out above, events have overtaken the agreement reached by the parties. The order sought by the amicus would have Mr McBride reinstated in a post he does not intend to return to. At least notionally, it would displace the present executive director of IPID and at the very least would render his appointment questionable, without him or her being heard.
