In the wide sense of the word ‘costs’ (expensae litis) are the expenses incurred by a litigant in actions or other legal proceedings, and they consist of money due to the attorney for his fees and disbursements, the latter embracing 3 counsel’s fees, stamps upon documents, sheriff’s fees and witness expenses. When granting an order in favour of a lay litigant who appears in person, the court should not simply use the word ‘costs’ but should rather make an order in terms of 4 which the lay litigant is awarded ‘costs limited to actual disbursements reasonably incurred’.",

Secondly, while the former contains the same amounts as the latter, it may in certain cases indicate bigger amounts for the same items. 13 It is not possible that the bill for party and party costs may contain items which do not appear on the bill for attorney and client 14 costs or that the former may stipulate a higher amount than the latter for the same item.",

The justification for an order that an applicant is to pay the respondent’s costs of opposition is that the respondent ought not to be put in a position where he opposes the granting of an indulgence at his peril, in the sense that, if the amendment is granted, he cannot recover his costs of opposition, or may even have to pay such costs as are occasioned by his opposition, despite the fact that such opposition 74 is reasonable in the circumstances. A respondent who opposes an application only to resist the costs order sought against 75 it is entitled to the costs of opposing the application if it is successful in warding off the costs order. If a respondent unreasonably opposes an application for an indulgence he may therefore be deprived of his costs of opposition and, in 76 appropriate circumstances, be ordered to pay the costs of opposition.",

When the appeal was eventually heard, the State parties were only represented by two counsel in appeal 1175/2021 and as previously, the two other counsel in appeal 997/2021. Money that could be made available for the payment of compensation to worthy claimants was wasted on unnecessary legal costs. There was simply no explanation as to why that many counsel were briefed. It would accordingly not be appropriate for the State Attorney to recover from its clients in appeal 1175/2021 the fees and expenses of more than one senior and one junior counsel.’",

On the other hand, the order cannot be justified merely as a form of compensation for damages suffered. The true explanation of awards of attorney and client costs not expressly authorized by statute is that, by reason of special considerations arising either from the circumstances which give rise to the action or from the conduct of the losing party, the court in a particular case considers it just, by means of such an order, to ensure more effectually than it can do by means of a judgment for party and party costs that the successful party will not be out of pocket in respect of the expenses caused to him by the litigation. Theoretically, a party and party bill taxed in accordance with the tariff will be reasonably sufficient for that purpose. However, in fact a party may have incurred expense which is reasonably necessary but is not chargeable in the party and party bill. Therefore in a 227 particular case the court will try to ensure, as far as it can, that the successful party is recouped.",

It is pointed out that Roos Taxation of Bills of Costs contains no reference to Nel v Waterberg Landbouwers Ko- 301 300 and that the difference in Roos’s levels of taxation is inconsistent with the Nel decision. operatiewe Vereeniging The court held that the South African law of costs knows only three principles or bases of taxation of attorney and client costs. In ascending order of strictness (or descending order of generosity to the costs creditor), they are taxation of a bill for payment of an attorney by his own client; taxation of a bill for payment of attorney and client costs out of a common fund; and 302 taxation of a bill for payment of attorney and client costs by one party to another. The proposition that the latter basis 303 gives little more than taxation as between party and party has never reflected the law anywhere in South Africa. An order that a party pay the costs of another party as between attorney and own client has no meaning in law beyond the 304 requirements of an order to tax as between attorney and client. However, in an inter-party taxation as between attorney 305 and client, the taxing master is not necessarily confined to the tariff and a more complete recoupment is envisaged.",

On 21 June 2022, the High Court granted an order directing that the 2017 order would remain operative pending the finalization of the application by the Minister in the Constitutional Court for a revival of the 2017 order, alternatively, pending the enactment of the necessary legislative amendments to the Immigration Act 13 of 2002, in the event that such amendments had been effected before the hearing of the application in Constitutional Court. In 2023, the Minister and the Director-General approached the Constitutional Court on an ex parte basis by way of an urgent direct access application for what was termed in the notice of motion a ‘revival’ of the 2017 order. Lawyers for Human Rights were admitted as an intervening party. The costs issues confronting the Constitutional Court were as follows:",

An order for personal costs against a person acting in a representative capacity is in itself inherently punitive. The imposition of costs on an attorney and client scale is an additional punitive measure. This could, as pointed out in the first judgment, be viewed as “double punishment”. While the test for awarding a personal costs order or costs on a punitive scale may overlap, an independent, separate enquiry should be carried out by a court in respect of each order. Both personal and punitive costs orders are extraordinary in nature and should not be awarded “willy-nilly”, but rather only in exceptional circumstances.",

The punitive costs mechanism exists to counteract reprehensible behaviour on the part of a litigant. As explained by this court in Eskom, the usual costs order on a scale as between party and party is theoretically meant to ensure that the successful party is not left “out of pocket” in respect of expenses incurred by them in the litigation. Almost invariably, however, a costs order on a party and party scale will be insufficient to cover all the expenses incurred by the successful party in the litigation. An award of punitive costs on an attorney and client scale may be warranted in circumstances where it would be unfair to expect a party to bear any of the costs occasioned by litigation.’",

The Court therefore reversed the costs order that the High Court had made against her office. In case no CCT 406 233/19 the Court held that the costs order by the High Court against the Public Protector in her personal capacity had been unfounded. The Court pointed out that personal costs orders against public officials were primarily aimed at vindicating the Constitution and ensuring that public officials who flout the Constitution were held accountable. In this instance the High Court furnished no reasons for the personal costs order made by it and, evidently, there was no factual basis for the order. Consequently, the order was set aside.",

For statutory limitations, see, for example, s 15 of the Domestic Violence Act 116 of 1998 and s 16 of the Protection from Harassment Act 17 of 2011, both of which provide that the court may make an order as to costs against a party only if it is satisfied that such party has acted frivolously, vexatiously or unreasonably. 49 Fripp v Gibbon & Co 1913 AD 354 at 363; and see Educated Risk Investments 54 (Pty) Ltd v The Master of the High Court, Johannesburg (unreported, GJ case no 18358/2020 dated 27 September 2021) at paragraph [21]; Agility Holdings (Pty) Ltd v Company Tribunal (unreported, GP case no 92630/2019 dated 11 February 2022) at paragraph [3.6]; Ideal Trading 199 CC v Polokwane Local Municipality (unreported, LP case no 3087/2021 dated 15 August 2023) at paragraph [10].

    "text": "59 There is no principle that a costs order cannot be made against a respondent in an unopposed matter. While there might be sound policy considerations why, for example, the respondent in a review application (such as a public body, a magistrate, a master of the High Court or an arbitrator) would not be required to pay the costs of an application, save in the event of opposition, the same considerations do not apply to applications for relief against ordinary commercial entities (Glencore Africa Oil Investments (Pty) Ltd v Ramano 2020 (3) SA 419 (GJ)). In EP Property Projects (Pty) Ltd v Registrar of Deeds, Cape Town, and Four Related Applications 2014 (1)SA 141 (WCC) it was accepted in principle that potentially a non-party funder could be liable, in the exercise of the court’s discretion, for an adverse costs order made against the funded party. In that case, the court ordered the funder to pay the costs in circumstances where she was in full control of the litigation, the claim being ceded to her and she stood to benefit substantially financially if the funded party was successful. See also Gold Fields Ltd v Motley Rice LLC 2015 (4) SA 299 (GP) at paragraphs [44]–[49] and Price Waterhouse Coopers Inc v IMF (Australia) Ltd 2013 (6) SA 216 (GNP). The aforesaid cases are not authority for making a costs order against a father on the tenuous basis that he may be financially assisting his major son in resisting a delictual damages claim (Merryweather v Scholtz (unreported, WCC case no 7965/2009 dated 22 June 2021) at paragraph [159]).",

The court held that the plaintiff’s right to privacy had been infringed, but that he was not, in the circumstances, entitled to more than ‘nominal’ damages, in the amount of R1 000. He was also found to be an untruthful witness. Nevertheless, it was held that he had been entitled to establish his right to privacy.

In Levin v Corrigan (unreported, GJ case no 45456/17 dated 16 April 2020) the High Court, in ordering the case to be transferred to the magistrate’s court in terms of Uniform Rule of Court 39(22), and after a consideration of the relevant principles relating to costs, held (at paragraph [27]) that ‘the sensible and appropriate order is to reserve all costs incurred to date for determination by the trial court at the appropriate time’. 145 Kock v Realty Corporation of SA 1918 TPD 356 at 360; Palmer v Goldberg 1961 (4) SA 781 (N) at 786; Keyter v De Wet NO 1967 (1) SA 25 (O) at 27–8; Jones v Union and South West Insurance Co Ltd 1970 (2) SA 768 (E) at 769; Barnard v SA Mutual Fire & General Insurance Co Ltd 1979 (2) SA 1012 (SE) at 1014; Holgate v Minister of Justice 1995 (3) SA 921 (E) at 937I–938B. 146 Grobbelaar v Kapotes 1927 TPD 195 at 198; White v Saker & Co 1938 WLD 173; Hunt v Campbell 1945 WLD 1 at 5; Milk Traders’ Trustee Co (Pty) Ltd v Levin 1953 (3) SA 678 (W) at 688; Champion v Said et Uxor 1958 (1) SA 360 (N) at 362; Ramsuran v Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd 1965 (2) SA 263 (D) at 265; Keyter v De Wet NO 1967 (1) SA 25 (O) at 27–8; Jones v Union and South West Insurance Co Ltd 1970 (2) SA 768 (E) at 769–70; Holgate v Minister of Justice 1995 (3) SA 921 (E) at 937I–938B; Paterson NO v Kelvin Park Properties CC 1998 (2) SA 89 (E) at 33. 147 De Winter v Ajmeri Properties and Investments 1957 (2) SA 297 (D) at 299; Rajah v Manning 1959 (1) SA 834 (N) at 836; Palmer v Goldberg 1961 (4) SA 781 (N) at 785; Ramsuran v Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd 1965 (2) SA 263 (D) at 264; Jeftha v Williams 1981 (3) SA 678 (C) at 685; Manamela v Minister of Justice 1960 (2) SA 395 (A) at 404; Dladla v Minister of Police 1973 (2) SA 714 (W) at 720. 148 Robertson & Stewart v Edwards 1908 EDC 186; Franks v Muller and Schonken 1929 TPD 464 at 476; Morkel v Dingley 1944 NPD 18; Gelb v Hawkins 1960 (3) SA 687 (A) at 694; Keyter v De Wet NO 1967 (1) SA 25 (O) at 27. 149 Kock v Realty Corporation of SA 1918 TPD 356 at 360; Palmer v Goldberg 1961 (4) SA 781 (N) at 786; Keyter v De Wet NO 1967 (1) SA 25 (O) at 27–8; Jones v Union and South West Insurance Co Ltd 1970 (2) SA 768 (E) at 769; Barnard v SA Mutual Fire & General Insurance Co Ltd 1979 (2) SA 1012 (SE) at 1014. 150 Kriek v Gunter 1940 OPD 136 at 140; Hunt v Campbell 1945 WLD 1 at 6; Ramsuran v Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd 1965 (2) SA 263 (D) at 265; Hassen v Post Newspapers (Pty) Ltd 1965 (3) SA 562 (W) at 577; Tsekahale v Minister van Polisie 1971 (2) SA 442 (O) at 443; Greeff v Raubenheimer 1976 (3) SA 37 (A) at 44; Moyer v Shield Insurance Co Ltd 1980 (3) SA 468 (C) at 470; Kritzinger v Perskorporasie van Suid-Afrika (Edms) Bpk 1981 (2) SA 373 (O) at 390; Jasat v Paruk 1983 (4) SA 728 (N) at 735; Iyman v Natal Witness Printing & Publishing Co (Pty) Ltd 1991 (4) SA 677 (N) at 687G–H. 151 Standard Credit Corporation Ltd v Bester 1987 (1) SA 812 (W) at 821.

Where the plaintiff gave notice of withdrawal and undertook to pay the defendant’s costs to date, but the defendant went on to apply for judgment for costs, the defendant was ordered to pay the costs of the application, since it was unnecessary to have brought it (Mervis & Co v Rom Ltd 1926 OPD 244; Ngoduka v SAR & H 1935 EDL 284). However, in Kajee v Minister of Justice 1952 (3) SA 467 (N) it was held (at 469F–470H) that the defendant was entitled to apply for judgment for costs, as a judgment for costs was worth more to him than an offer to pay the costs. See also A v B and C 1976 (4) SA 31 (SR) at 33D–F. The view expressed in the latter two decisions is to be preferred above that taken in the Mervis and Ngoduka decisions.

The punitive costs mechanism exists to counteract reprehensible behaviour on the part of a litigant.’ In Ex parte Minister of Home Affairs 2024 (2) SA 58 (CC) the Constitutional Court unanimously described a personal costs order on an attorney and client scale as ‘double punishment’ (at paragraph [91]). In the same judgment the Court held that a ‘punitive costs order is justified where the conduct concerned is extraordinary and deserving of a court’s rebuke’; it serves ‘to convey a court’s displeasure at a party’s reprehensible conduct’ (at paragraph [92]). In Zuma v Democratic Alliance 2021 (5) SA 189 (SCA) the Supreme Court of Appeal stated (at paragraph [51]): ‘There is nothing on the record to sustain the inference that the presiding judges in this matter (or at a more generalised level in other matters involving Mr Zuma) were biased or that they were not open-minded, impartial or fair. The allegations were made with a reckless disregard for the truth and persisted in during argument. They ought not to have been made at all. But, having been made, they ought, in response to the invitation from the EFF, to have been retracted. To have persisted in the unjustified criticism of not just the high court, but more generally the judiciary, is plainly deserving of censure. Little wonder then that the EFF submits that Mr Zuma should be penalised with a punitive costs order as a mark of this Court’s displeasure and to vindicate the integrity of the high court and the judiciary. A submission, for the reasons given, with which I am in agreement.’ In Municipal Manager O.R. Tambo District Municipality v Ndabeni [2022] 5 BLLR 393 (CC) the O.R. Tambo District Municipality was ordered by the Constitutional Court to pay the respondent’s costs on an attorney and client scale because ‘[a] punitive costs order will assuage some of the harm perpetrated against Ms Ndabeni’ as a result of the municipality’s dilatoriness, inertia and unaccountability. 227 The whole of the paragraph is taken from Nel v Waterberg Landbouwers Ko-operatiewe Vereeniging 1946 AD 597 at 607. In this case the jurisdiction of a superior court to award attorney and client costs was exhaustively examined for the first time.

In Public Protector v South African Reserve Bank 2019 (6) SA 253 (CC) the majority of the Constitutional Court, with reference to Limpopo Legal Solutions v Eskom Holdings Soc Ltd 2017 (12) BCLR 1497 (CC), stated, amongst others (at 317G–318 — footnotes omitted): ‘As explained by this court in Eskom, the usual costs order on a scale as between party and party is theoretically meant to ensure that the successful party is not left “out of pocket” in respect of expenses incurred by them in the litigation. Almost invariably, however, a costs order on a party and party scale will be insufficient to cover all the expenses incurred by the successful party in the litigation.’ 228 This has frequently been reiterated: De Villiers v Murraysburg School Board 1910 CPD 535; Mallinson v Tanner 1947 (4) SA 681 (T); Van Wyk v Millington 1948 (1) SA 1205 (C); Moosa v Lalloo 1957 (4) SA 207 (O); De Goede v Venter 1959 (3) SA 959 (O); Goode, Durrant and Murray (SA) Ltd v Stephenson NO (2) 1961 (1) SA 657 (SR); Van Dyk v Conradie 1963 (2) SA 413 (C); Simmons NO v Gilbert Hamer & Co Ltd 1963 (1) SA 897 (N); Keyter v De Wet NO 1967 (1) SA 25 (O); L F Boshoff Investments (Pty) Ltd v Cape Town Municipality 1969 (2) SA 256 (C); Ward v Sulzer 1973 (3) SA 701 (A); Waar v Louw 1977 (3) SA 297 (O); Engineering Management Services (Pty) Ltd v South Cape Corporation (Pty) Ltd 1979 (3) SA 1341 (W) at 1344C–1345H; Pieter Bezuidenhout-Larochelle Boerdery (Edms) Bpk v Wetorius Boerdery (Edms) Bpk 1983 (2) SA 233 (O) at 237; W v S (1) 1988 (1) SA 475 (N) at 498; Snyman v Sentraboer 1988 (3) SA 919 (O); Ridon v Van der Spuy and Partners (Wes-Kaap) Inc 2002 (2) SA 121 (C) at 140C; Bovungana v Road Accident Fund 2009 (4) SA 123 (E) at 133G– H; Public Protector v South African Reserve Bank 2019 (6) SA 253 (CC) at 317D–F and 319A–320B; Gordhan v The Public Protector [2021] 1 All SA 428 (GP) (a decision of the full court) at paragraph [304]; Benatar v Black Academic Caucus (unreported, WCC case no 18821/2020 dated 15 December 2021) at paragraphs 67–75. 229 Peter Cooper & Company (Previously Cooper and Ferreira) v De Vos [1998] 2 All SA 237 (E) at 253–4.

In Bond Equipment (Pretoria) (Pty) Ltd v ABSA Bank Ltd 1999 (2) SA 63 (W), attorney and client costs were ordered against a party which had forced a postponement as a result of a last minute attempt to amend a pleading; a practice which, the court held, was strongly to be deprecated as it interferes with the smooth flow of litigation, which it is the duty of the courts, counsel and attorneys to uphold. 268 Caluza v Minister of Justice 1969 (1) SA 251 (N). In Mudzimu v Chinhoyi Municipality 1986 (3) SA 140 (Z) at 143 it is stressed that such deplorable and contemptuous conduct must bring about additional and unwarranted expense to the other party in order to warrant an order of attorney and client costs — offensive behaviour towards the court or its officials is irrelevant, as far as costs are concerned, if it does not have this effect.

In granting the order, the court ordered the respondents to pay the costs of the application as between attorney and own client, as the respondents had evinced an intention and determination to litigate persistently and vexatiously and had demonstrated a lack of bona fides, having launched an avalanche of unmeritorious applications, actions and private prosecutions and in the process making unsubstantiated and groundless allegations of fraud, dishonesty and criminal acts against the applicants. In Christensen NO v Richter (unreported, GP case no 73868/2016 dated 6 October 2017) a similar costs order was made against the first respondent in proceedings instituted against him under the Vexatious Proceedings Act 3 of 1956. In Gouws v Taxing Mistress (Port Elizabeth) (unreported, ECPE case nos 3300/2018 and 525/2018 dated 5 November 2020) the court declined to make a punitive costs order against the party who was declared a vexatious litigant under the Vexatious Proceedings Act 3 of 1956.",

In Njongi v MEC, Department of Welfare, Eastern Cape 2008 (4) SA 237 (CC) at 264A–268D a provincial government was, however, ordered to pay costs on the scale as between attorney and client where, in an application for payment of a social grant, both its decision to oppose the application and the way in which the case was conducted represented unconscionable conduct on the part of the provincial government. In Nyathi v MEC for Department of Health, Gauteng 2008 (5) SA 94 (CC) at 114E–116A and 123C–E the Constitutional Court, in awarding costs against the respondent, alluded to the ‘ineffective negligent acts of State officials [which] resulted in a comedy of errors which could easily have been avoided’. See also South African Liquor Traders’ Association v Chairperson, Gauteng Liquor Board 2009 (1) SA 565 (CC) at 581F–582G, where a costs order was made against the office of the State Attorney de bonis propriis on the scale as between attorney and client. 430 Section 10 of the Divorce Act 70 of 1979. 431 Section 10 of the Divorce Act 70 of 1979.

On the alleged trend of courts to employ the Biowatch principle, see Sello Ivan Phale ‘Biowatch betrayal denies justice’ 10 January 2024 Mail & Guardian. In Secretary, Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture v Zuma 2021 (5) SA 1 (CC) the Constitutional Court, in granting costs against former President Zuma, stated: ‘[112] Although the respondent has not opposed the relief sought, the Commission asked for costs against him. The Commission contended that it was the unlawful conduct on the part of the respondent which forced it to approach and seek relief from this court. If the respondent had obeyed the process lawfully issued by the Commission, continued the argument, the Commission would not have been compelled to institute and fund litigation whose purpose was to stop the respondent’s unlawful conduct. [113] The rule that a private party that loses in constitutional litigation against organs of state should be spared from liability to pay costs, does not apply here. This rule was designed to protect private parties which raised genuine constitutional issues. This is not such a case. Indeed, Biowatch cautioned: “At the same time, however, the general approach of this Court to costs in litigation between private parties and the state, is not unqualified. If an application is frivolous or vexatious, or in any other way manifestly inappropriate, the applicant should not expect that the worthiness of its cause will immunise it against an adverse costs award.” [114] This holds true also in respect of respondents who raise frivolous defences or whose unlawful conduct has forced the state to litigate. Like the applicants described above, they do not enjoy any immunity against adverse costs orders. But here the costs order is justified by the reprehensible conduct of the respondent towards the Commission. By ignoring process from the Commission, he did not only contravene the Commissions Act but he also breached regulations made by him for the effective operation of the Commission. His conduct seriously undermined the Commission’s investigation, that included matters on which the respondent may be the only witness with personal knowledge. For example, as the President at the relevant time, the respondent was the only person who could appoint and dismiss Ministers from Cabinet. And the Commission was mandated to investigate issues relating to the appointment and dismissal of Ministers from Cabinet during the respondent’s presidency. These facts outweigh the respondent’s decision not to oppose the relief sought.’ See also Helen Suzman Foundation v The Speaker of the National Assembly (unreported, SCA case no 484/2021 dated 3 February 2023) at paragraph [8]. 435 Ex parte De Vos 1953 (2) SA 642 (SR) at 643D–H; Komape v Minister of Basic Education 2020 (2) SA 347 (SCA) at paragraph [71]. See, however, K obo M v Road Accident Fund 2023 (3) SA 125 (GP) where the full court ordered the Road Accident Fund to pay the costs of the amici on the scale as between party and party, and holding the balance of the costs remaining to be ‘a consequence of the amici’s own choice of becoming involved in the litigation’ (at paragraphs [69] and [70]). 436 In Western Cape Gambling and Racing Board v Sunwest International t/a Grandwest Casino & Entertainment World (unreported, SCA case no 1330/2021 dated 4 September 2023) the amicus curiae unsuccessfully applied for leave to introduce further evidence on appeal. It was ordered to pay the respondents’ costs in that regard (at paragraphs [25] and [27]). 437 Sing v Sing 1911 TPD 1034 at 1038–9; Michell v Additional Magistrate Salisbury 1954 (2) SA 93 (SR) at 95; Clifford Harris (Pty) Ltd v SGB Building Equipment (Pty) Ltd 1980 (2) SA 141 (T) at 152. An amendment to include a prayer for costs will usually be granted, unless there is some good reason to refuse it (Jacobs v Joyce & McGregor 1937 CPD 468 at 470). 438 Sing v Sing 1911 TPD 1034 at 1038–9; see the remarks of Greenberg J in Johannesburg Commercial Finance Co v Hurwitz 1935 WLD 131, followed in Wecke & Voigts v Smit 1943 SWA 32. In Northern Burglar Proof Gate & Fence Co Ltd v Venite Construction (Pty) Ltd 1977 (1) SA 708 (W) the plaintiff had applied for judgment by default for the payment of an amount of money, interest and costs. The summons contained no prayer for interest a tempore morae and for costs. The plaintiff applied to amend the summons to include a claim for interest and costs. The court granted judgment for the amount and for costs and ordered that copy of the order to be served upon the defendant by the deputy-sheriff. The defendant was given leave to move to set aside the order as to costs within 14 days of such service on proof of",

    "text": "453 There have been attempts to apply this principle so as to allow a plaintiff to ask that a defendant be not allowed to proceed with his defence if he has failed to pay the costs ordered in respect of an interlocutory application. It seems a startling proposition that a defendant unable to pay such costs should therefore be compelled to submit to any judgment claimed against him by the plaintiff. The only case where a decision to that effect has been given is Adams v Macdonald (1904) 25 NLR 203. That was a very exceptional case, as the defendant had been found guilty of contempt and ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings for contempt. Upon his failing to do so he was restrained from further proceedings. Even this decision was much doubted in Michaelson v Kent 1913 TPD 48; and the view there expressed was that, unless the refusal to pay the costs was vexatious, the principle which restrains a plaintiff from harassing a defendant with a series of unsuccessful actions cannot bar a defendant from being heard in his defence. There is, however, a casual remark of Juta JP in Goncalves v Fernandez 1918 CPD 10 which suggests that the principle might be applied to a defendant. In M’biza v Puza 1918 TPD 1 the defendant asked for a postponement, which was granted on condition that he paid the costs of the day before the hearing was resumed. He did not pay, and at the resumed hearing evidence was given that his omission to do so was vexatious. He was barred, and judgment given for the plaintiff. On appeal it was doubted whether the court had power to decide in advance that there would be a bar if costs were not paid by a particular day. The appeal was upheld and the case remitted to take the defendant’s evidence. Bristowe J considered that the defendant might be barred from proceeding if the refusal to pay costs was contumacious.",
