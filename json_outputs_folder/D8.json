In the Western Cape Division of the High 60 Court, Cape Town, for example, strict rules have been laid down for the execution of the order. It is settled law that serious 61 Not irregularities in the execution of the order can render it susceptible to being discharged on a reconsideration thereof. 62 every failure to comply with the order will justify the discharge or setting aside of the order. The test is whether the 63 execution is so seriously flawed that the court should show its displeasure or disapproval by setting aside the order. A serious flaw would include conduct that could be regarded as blatantly abusive, oppressive or contemptuous, but would not be limited to conduct of such extreme nature. The more drastic and potentially harmful the remedy may be, the more closely it has to be scrutinized by the court and the more meticulously it must be applied and executed by all involved. Non-compliance with the order as far as execution is concerned may also attract a punitive costs order. Other options include the setting aside of the entire order or the setting aside of certain aspects of the execution. Where the applicant failed to serve the application before execution and thereafter failed to furnish the application until the matter was contested in court, it was held 64 that the setting aside of the order was justified.",

In considering whether an applicant in an Anton Piller application who has the condictio furtiva or another delictual remedy to its disposal, succeeds in establishing prima facie that it has a cause of action, the court needs to determine whether the facts that the applicant places before the court provide reasonable grounds for establishing the elements of delictual liability, inclusive of fault or mala fides, if the latter is required (Richards Bay Titatnium (Pty) Ltd v Cosco Shipping Logistics Africa (Pty) Ltd (unreported, GP case no 020911/ 2023 dated 2 June 2023) at paragraph [64]).

An overly wide order is not competent (Non-Detonating Solutions (Pty) Ltd v Durie 2016 (3) SA 445 (SCA) at paragraph [29]; Richards Bay Titatnium (Pty) Ltd v Cosco Shipping Logistics Africa (Pty) Ltd (unreported, GP case no 020911/ 2023 dated 2 June 2023) at paragraph [71]). The specificity requirement, however, does not prohibit search and seizure orders for specific classes of documents (Non-Detonating Solutions (Pty) Ltd v Durie 2016 (3) SA 445 (SCA) at paragraph [36]). In Non-Detonating Solutions the Supreme Court of Appeal expressly stated that the requirement does not mean that ‘only individual documents identified by, for example, date or origin are properly liable to be attached’ (at paragraph [39]); and see Richards Bay Titatnium (Pty) Ltd v Cosco Shipping Logistics Africa (Pty) Ltd (unreported, GP case no 020911/ 2023 dated 2 June 2023) at paragraph [73]. The applicant must produce clear evidence that the respondent has the items in his possession or that there are good grounds for believing so; a respondent should not be exposed to attachment and removal of his documents on grounds that are speculative or fail clearly to make out a case for relief (Roamer Watch Co SA v African Textile Distributors also t/a M K Patel Wholesale Merchants and Direct Importers 1980 (2) SA 254 (W) at 272–273; Shoba v Officer Commanding, Temporary Police Camp, Wagendrift Dam; Maphanga v Officer Commanding, South African Police Murder and Robbery Unit, Pietermaritzburg 1995 (4) SA 1 (A) at 15H–I; Non-Detonating Solutions (Pty) Ltd v Durie 2016 (3) SA 445 (SCA) at paragraph [36]; Viziya Corporation v Collaborit Holdings (Pty) Ltd 2019 (3) SA 173 (SCA) at 185F–G; Samancor Chrome Limited v Tennant Metals South Africa (Pty) Ltd (unreported, GJ case no 2021/17223 dated 25 October 2021) at paragraph [19]; Richards Bay Titatnium (Pty) Ltd v Cosco Shipping Logistics Africa (Pty) Ltd (unreported, GP case no 020911/ 2023 dated 2 June 2023) at paragraph [72]; Lasercraft Mergence (Pty) Ltd v Dreyer (unreported, GJ case no 2023-044109 dated 26 February 2024) at paragraph 14).

The test posed in Ex parte Matshini 1986 (3) SA 605 (E) at 613A–C, that the evidence must be ‘essential’ or ‘absolutely necessary’, poses too stringent a test (Sun World International Inc v Unifruco Ltd 1998 (3) SA 151 (C) 151 at 169G–170B). In Lourenco v Ferela (Pty) Ltd (No 1) 1998 (3) SA 281 (T) the applicant failed to satisfy this requirement (see at 299E–I).
