It would, therefore, be improper for an attorney to sign pleadings in a different area of jurisdiction from where such certificate was issued and any pleadings so signed could be 33 set aside. In Absa Bank Ltd v Barinor New Business Venture (Pty) Ltd the court, following the Zeda case in this regard, held that an attorney enrolled and with right of appearance registered at High Court A, needs to be enrolled at High Court B to practise there, and so to sign a combined summons there. The attorney’s right of appearance need not though be registered 34 at High Court B, for him to appear there. In Liberty Group Ltd v Singh it was, however, held that the certificate of a registrar under s 4(2) of the Right of Appearance in Courts Act 62 of 1995, to the effect that an attorney has the right of appearance in the High Court, confers on that attorney the right to appear before, and carry out the functions of an advocate in, all the divisions of the High Court. The certificate also entitles the attorney to sign pleadings, qua advocate, in all divisions of the High Court, but the attorney’s right to sign pleadings qua attorney is limited to the division of the High Court in which he was admitted or enrolled.",

In addition an allegation that the party has taken steps to obtain a copy, without success, or to annex an incomplete, or unsigned, draft thereof, would not for the same reason constitute compliance with the demands of rule 18(6), nor would it excuse their non-compliance. It is therefore clear that a party who bases its cause of action upon a written agreement should obtain a true copy of the agreement before advancing its claim. However, this is not to say that a failure to annex a written agreement relied upon may never be condoned in terms of rule 27(3). Good cause would have to be shown why the party concerned is unable, at that stage, to annex a copy of the written agreement relied upon. Relevant considerations would be the steps taken to obtain a copy of the written agreement and the prospects of the written agreement being obtained in the future. That a true copy will be available before the issues arising therefrom have to be determined will be of particular importance in this regard. In addition any prejudice to the opposing party caused by the failure to annex the agreement to the pleading would have to be considered. Of significance in this regard would be whether the pleading concisely and clearly sets out the terms relied upon in the written agreement upon which the cause of action is based, and is not excipiable. The above factors are not exhaustive and each case will have to be decided upon its individual merits.’ In Dass and Others NNO v Lowewest Trading (Pty) Ltd condoned in the absence of prejudice to the other party. 84 Tshabalala JP held that non-compliance with rule 18(6) can be 85 In Absa Bank Ltd v Zalvest Twenty (Pty) Ltd 86 the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a written mortgage loan agreement. Ultimately the defendant defaulted and the plaintiff sought judgment against it. In its particulars of claim, the plaintiff alleged that it was unable to annex a copy of the loan agreement to its pleadings resulting from the fact that the document had been destroyed in a fire and no other copy of it could be found. The defendant excepted to the particulars of claim on the basis that rule 18(6) had not been complied with. The defendant contended that the import of rule 18(6) was that the inability of the plaintiff to annex a copy of the loan agreement to its particulars of claim resulted in it having no cause 87 88 of action. In dismissing the exception, Traverso DJP and Rogers J, inter alia, stated (per Rogers J): ‘The rules of court exist in order to ensure fair play and good order in the conduct of litigation. The rules do not lay down the substantive legal requirements for a cause of action, nor in general are they concerned with the substantive law of evidence. The substantive law is to be found elsewhere, mainly in litigation and the common law. There is no rule of substantive law to the effect that the party to a written contract is precluded",

    "text": "from enforcing it merely because the contract has been destroyed or lost. Even where a contract is required by law to be in writing (e g a contract for the sale of land or a suretyship), what the substantive law requires is that the written contract in accordance with the prescribed formalities should have been executed; the law does not say that the contract ceases to be of effect if it is destroyed or lost. In regard to the substantive law of evidence, the original signed contract is the best evidence that a valid contract was concluded, and the general rule is thus that the original must be adduced. But there are exceptions to this rule, one of which is where the original has been destroyed or cannot be found despite a diligent search. In such a case the litigant who relies on the contract can adduce secondary evidence of its conclusion and terms (see Singh v Govender Brothers Construction 1986 (3) SA 613 (N) at 616J–617D). There are in modern law no degrees of secondary evidence (i e one does not have to adduce the “best” secondary evidence). While a copy of the lost original might be better evidence than oral evidence regarding the conclusion and terms of the contract, both forms of evidence are admissible once the litigant is excused from producing the original . . . That then is the substantive law. The rules of court exist to facilitate the ventilation of disputes arising from substantive law. The rules of court may only regulate matters of procedure; they cannot make or alter substantive law (United Reflective Converters (Pty) Ltd v Levine 1988 (4) SA 460 (W) at 463B–E and authority there cited). The court is, moreover, not a slave to the rules of court. As has often been said, the rules exist for the courts, not the courts for the rules . . . A rule which purported to say that a party to a written contract was deprived of a cause of action if the written document was destroyed or lost would be ultra vires. But the rules say no such thing. Rule 18(6) is formulated on the assumption that the pleader is able to attach a copy of the written contract. In those circumstances the copy (or relevant part thereof) must be annexed. Rule 18(6) is not intended to compel compliance with the impossible . . . Rule 27(3) provides that the court may on good cause shown condone any non-compliance with the rules. I am by no means certain that a party in the position of the plaintiff in the present case needs to rely on rule 27(3). On a proper interpretation of rule 18(6) itself, there is arguably a necessary implication that a copy need not be attached if it is impossible for the pleader to do so, though to avoid an objection to the particulars of claim the pleader should explain the inability. To say that the court could in its discretion under rule 27(3) condone the non-annexing of a copy (in circumstances where the plaintiff is unable to attach a copy) implies that the court could notionally in such circumstances refuse to condone the non-annexing. I rather doubt whether a rule conferring such a power would be valid. However, I need not finally decide that point because, if it is unsound, rule 27(3) confers the necessary power of condonation . . . The defendants’ counsel placed strong reliance on the judgment of Swain J in Moosa . . . The Moosa case is for several reasons distinguishable from the present one. Firstly, the defendants in Moosa did not contend by way of exception (as the defendants during the present case) that the plaintiffs lack a cause of action because they were unable to annex a copy of the written agreement; they contended that the failure to annex the agreement was an irregular step, and they launched an application on affidavit to make good that contention. The court was placed in possession of information on affidavit which indicated that the plaintiffs were indeed in possession of a copy of the agreement. Second,",

    "text": "the plaintiffs in Moosa did not, as the plaintiffs have done in the present case, seek condonation for the failure to annex a copy of the agreement. Third, the explanation offered by the plaintiffs in Moosa was a bald allegation that they were not in possession of a copy of the agreement, whereas in the present case the plaintiff has alleged that the mortgage loan agreement was destroyed in a fire on a specified date and that despite a diligent search the plaintiff has been unable to find a copy of the agreement. Given the nature of the exception proceedings, the plaintiff’s allegation as to the destruction of the mortgage loan agreement and the inability to locate a copy must be accepted a true. The present case can thus be distinguished from Moosa. The latter case is not authority for the proposition that a plaintiff is deprived of its cause of action merely because it is unable to annex a copy of the agreement to its pleading. I have no difficulty in accepting the correctness of Swain J’s ultimate conclusion in the rule 30 application which served before him, having regard to the particular facts disclosed in the affidavits. However, there are passages in his judgment which suggest that rule 18(6) applies even where it is impossible for the plaintiff to annex a copy of the written agreement on which he relies; that even in such a case the plaintiff requires condonation in terms of rule 27(3); and that the court might refuse condonation if it appeared, for example, that a true copy of the agreement would not be available by the time of the trial. I respectfully consider that this is going too far. If it is impossible for the plaintiff to produce a written contract or a copy thereof, the law allows him to prove the execution and terms of the written contract by other evidence. A rule of procedure cannot deprive the plaintiff of his cause of action or of his right to adduce secondary evidence of the contract, though the rules would still require the plaintiff to plead with appropriate particularity the conclusion of the contract and its terms. I also, with respect, disagree with the learned judge’s proposition that “(i)n the absence of the written agreement the basis of the [plaintiffs’] cause of action does not appear ex facie the pleadings” (para 18). If a plaintiff pleads the conclusion of a written contract and the terms relevant to his cause of action, the cause of action will appear ex facie the particulars of claim. That, after all, is how causes of action based on written contracts were legitimately pleaded prior to the amendment of rule 18(6) in 1987, at a time when there was no procedural requirements to annex the written contract. What is true is that since",

If the defendants consider that condonation is necessary and, if they wish to oppose condonation, a court could give procedural directions for the filing of affidavits. Alternatively the request for condonation in the particulars of claim could be tried as a separate issue in terms of rule 33(4). However, and unless the plaintiff’s allegations concerning the loss of the document by way of fire are untrue, the only other persons who are likely to be in possession of a copy of the mortgage loan agreement are the defendants themselves. At this stage we do not know that the defendants do not have a copy of the agreement. If they do have a copy of the agreement, they would obviously receive short shrift in opposing condonation. If they, like the plaintiff, do not have a copy, I have already explained why in my view the plaintiff would not be non-suited. This would either be because rule 18(6) does not apply to such a case or because condonation in terms of rule 27(3) could not properly be refused . . .",

The second respondent must pay the applicant’s costs in this court, such costs to include the costs of two counsel.’ A claim in terms of s 7(3) of the Divorce Act 70 of 1979 is a personal claim that arises not from delict or injury, but from the provisions of the Act. Divorce proceedings are personal to the parties and it is, accordingly, not competent for a party to a divorce action to pursue a claim in terms of s 7(3) if the marriage is already dissolved by the death of one of the spouses. This is so irrespective of whether litis contestatio has taken place (YG v Executor, Estate Late CGM 2013 (4) SA 387 (WCC) at 393F–I). In EB (Born S) (case no CCT 364/21) referred to above, the High Court, not following YG, held that because litis contestatio had been reached before the husband died, the wife could pursue her claim for a redistribution order to finality even if ordinarily s 7(3) of the Divorce Act 70 of 1979 did not apply to marital dissolution before death. The High Court’s decision in that regard was not before the Constitutional Court in EB (Born S) (case no CCT 364/21) as there was no appeal against it.",
