⚠️ Where it falls short (important for testing)

1. Missing specific subrule coverage

It omits or compresses certain details that are in the source text:

Subrule | Issue
Rule 54(2) | Completely omitted (committed for sentence under s 121 CPA)
Rule 54(4) | Does not mention payment of sheriff's lawful costs in private prosecutions
Rule 54(5) | Mentions subpoenas but doesn't clearly distinguish superior court vs Circuit Court exclusion
Rule 54(6)-(7) | Accurate but not explicitly linked to subrule numbers

For strict legal correctness, these omissions matter.

2. Lack of citation granularity

A strong legal chatbot answer should ideally:
- Tie statements to specific subrules (e.g. "Rule 54(1) provides that...")
- Especially important if your RAG is meant for lawyers or clerks, not lay users

This response is descriptive, not forensically precise.

3. No mention of historical amendments

Your source text includes:
"Subrule (x) substituted/amended by GN R480 of 30 March 1973 / GN R2410 of 30 September 1991"

The AI:
- X Ignores amendment history

This is acceptable for general explanation
- X But weak if your chatbot is meant to be authoritative or citation-grade
