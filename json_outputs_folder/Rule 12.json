    "text": "NIIN It was often said that the court has a discretion where a party seeks leave to intervene — a discretion which does not appear to exist where the non-joinder of a necessary party is raised by the defendant or the court mero motu — and that the power of the court to grant leave to intervene is wider than where joinder of another is demanded as of right (Venter v Wicht’s Garage 1927 CPD 364 at 365; Sheshe v Vereeniging Municipality 1951 SA 661 (A) at 666; Marais v Pongola Sugar Milling Co Ltd 1961 (2) SA 698 (N) at 702E; Ex parte Pearson and Hutton NNO 1967 (1) SA 103 (E) at 106G; Khumalo v Wilkins 1972 (4) SA 470 (N) at 475H. See also Bitcon v City Council of Johannesburg and Arenow Behrman & Co 1931 WLD 273 at 293-4 and Hetz v Empire Auctioneers & Estate Agents 1962 (1) SA 558 (T)). There has, however, been no authoritative definition of the limit of that discretion or of the category or categories of cases where the court would grant leave to intervene even though a plea of non-joinder could not succeed (United Watch & Diamond Co (Pty) Ltd v Disa Hotels Ltd 1972 (4) SA 409 (C) at 416A). When some decisions relating to intervention are examined, it appears that, as in the case of joinder as of right, the test of a direct and substantial interest in the subject matter of the action was regarded as being the decisive criterion (United Watch & Diamond Co (Pty) Ltd v Disa Hotels Ltd 1972 (4) SA 409 (C) at 416B).",

A person having a right of tenure derived from someone else can intervene in an action for ejectment against the person from whom he derives that right, where the ejectment would deprive him of his tenure; or if he had no knowledge of the proceedings at the time they were taken, he can subsequently move to have the writ of ejectment set aside (Ntai v Vereeniging Town Council 1953 (4) SA 579 (A) at 592G). In Vitorakis v Wolf 1973 (3) SA 928 (W) at 930G–H a different approach was adopted. The entitlement to ‘join as a plaintiff’ was sought, not in the criterion of a direct and substantial interest in the action, but in the wording of rule 10(1) in terms of which any number of persons may join as plaintiffs against the same defendant or defendants, provided that their right to relief is dependent upon the determination of substantially the same question of law or fact. This approach finds support in Herbstein & Van Winsen 6 ed vol 1 7–50 footnote 3, 7–51. It is submitted that the provisions of subrule 10(1) do not apply to the situation contemplated by this rule. Rule 10(1) deals with a situation where several plaintiffs, each with his own claim, join in one action against the same defendant or defendants. Rule 12 deals with the intervention in an action by persons who have a legal interest in the subject matter of litigation between other parties that may be prejudicially affected by the judgment of the court. Such persons must be allowed to intervene as plaintiffs or defendants in the action, not because they have separate claims or because separate claims may be brought against them, but because, as pointed out in the notes to this rule s v ‘General’ above, their legal interests which may be prejudicially affected coincide with those of the plaintiff or of the defendant in the action. In Shapiro v South African Recording Rights Association Ltd (Galeta Intervening) 2008 (4) SA 145 (W) it was held (at 150B–151E) that rule 12 covers both scenarios set out in the preceding paragraph and that, generally, the approach followed in Vitorakis v Wolf (supra) would apply to plaintiffs/applicants who wish to intervene, whereas the ‘direct and substantial interest’ approach would apply to respondents who wish to intervene.
