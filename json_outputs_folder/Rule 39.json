The parties came to court asking it to finalize the matter in the way that they had agreed, rather than beginning the trial anew. The proposed procedure was that the court read all of the documents that would have been available to the deceased judge; that it hear argument from the parties; and that it then make a decision. The court refused to give effect to the proposed procedure because it would be unable to resolve the many disputes of fact in the matter without resorting to the credibility of witnesses. If it were to decide the matter on the basis agreed, it would be in breach of its oath of office. The court directed that the trial begin de novo if the parties wished to continue with 13 the matter. In Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd v Sibanda the judge who presided at the trial became indisposed and unable to deliver judgment. The parties did not want the trial to begin de novo.

The conduct and finalisation of litigation in a speedy and cost-efficient manner is a collaborative effort.

First is the supervision, organisation and presentation of evidence of the witnesses and, secondly, the formulation and presentation of argument in support of a litigant’s case. The diligent observation of those roles facilitates the role of the judicial officer, which is to arrive at a reasoned determination of the issues in dispute, in favour of one or other of the parties. Where practitioners neglect their roles, it leads to the protracted conduct of the litigation in an ill-disciplined manner, the introduction of inadmissible evidence and the confusion of fact and argument, with the attendant increase in costs and delay in its finalisation, inimical to both expedition and economy.’",

Thus, he may be deprived of access or free access to evidence which is material against one or other of the defendants because that evidence is possessed by or under the control of the other defendant. 97 The court should exercise its discretion whether or not to grant absolution at the end of the plaintiff’s case upon a consideration of all the facts. Thus, for example, if it has already been disclosed (e g in summary judgment proceedings or in the pleadings) that the one defendant will endeavour to establish liability on the part of the other defendants absolution should not be granted even if at the end of the plaintiff’s case there is no evidence against such other defendants.

Similar considerations apply when the second defendant applies for absolution after the plaintiff and the first 99 defendant have led their evidence and closed their cases.",

The court should not consider in turn whether a prima facie case has been made out against the one defendant. In such a case, which is in effect a tripartite suit between three adversaries, it is in the interests of justice that the case should be decided on the evidence that all the parties may choose to place before the court, provided that the plaintiff, when presenting his case, has laid the necessary foundation of showing, prima facie, that one or other or both of the defendants are legally liable. If, however, the evidence for the plaintiff did not support a claim against the second defendant, and no case has been 101 made out against him, absolution from the instance against that defendant is proper.",

In such cases questions arise as to (a) the order in which the witnesses are to be examined; and (b) to whom the right of cross-examination should be accorded.

In Denby v Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality 2021 (1) SA 190 (GJ) the parties’ legal representatives had, after the issue of merits was settled in an action for damages arising from bodily injuries and made an order of court, agreed upon a joint memorandum seeking the court to make an order for payment in terms of a draft order to which the parties’ legal representatives had agreed, but the defendant itself not. It was held that by all accounts, the defendant had left it in the hands of its legal practitioners to deal with the matter. In the absence of something to the contrary, that would include making such admissions and confessions at a pre-trial conference as were appropriate, which would include the ultimate consequence of agreeing that an order be granted if that was the outcome of the pre-trial engagement. There was no suggestion that what the defendant’s legal representatives had agreed to was anything but bona fide, and in the circumstances the court would grant an order on the terms agreed to by the parties’ legal representatives (at paragraphs [26]–[28]).",

The position in divorce matters was stated as follows in PL v YL 2013 (6) SA 28 (ECG) at 53C–55D (footnotes omitted): ‘[45] With regard to the second question raised, once the court has made a consent judgment it is functus officio and the matter becomes res judicata. This means, inter alia, that as a general rule the court has no authority to correct, alter or supplement its own order that has been accurately drawn up. Subject to what is said hereunder, in divorce matters this is in practice effectively only limited to those terms of the order which deal with the proprietary rights of the parties and the payment of maintenance to one of the spouses where there is a non- variation clause. The reason for this is that the general rule is subject to a number of exceptions, in terms of the Divorce Act, the rules of court and at common law. The exceptions in the Divorce Act relate to matters which fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court, and which that Act requires the court to determine and to grant an order as it may find to be justified. Consequently, orders dealing with the custody, guardianship, or access to and the maintenance of any of the minor children do not assume the character of final judgments, as they are always subject to variation in terms of s 8(1) of the Divorce Act. [46] A further exception to the general rule that an order of court, once pronounced, is final and immutable, is created by s 8(1) of the Divorce Act. As stated, in the absence of a non-variation clause in the settlement agreement, it permits the court to rescind, vary or suspend a maintenance order granted earlier. Further, there exists in principle no reason why the parties may not subsequently seek an amendment thereof by mutual consent, or in circumstances where the order through error or oversight does not correctly reflect their agreement. Not only is the mandate of the court to exercise its discretion in terms of s 7(1) of the Divorce Act derived from the settlement agreement, but the consent order itself is based on the terms of that agreement. The legal nature of a consent order was considered by the appeal court in Swadif v Dyke. It was held that where the purpose of the granting of the consent judgment is to enable the parties to the agreement to enforce the terms thereof through the process of the court, should the need therefor arise, the effect of the order is to replace the right of action on the agreement by a right to execute on the judgment: “(I)t seems realistic, and in accordance with the views of the Roman-Dutch writers, to regard the judgment not as novating the obligation under the bond, but rather as strengthening or reinforcing it. The right of action . . . is replaced by the right to execute, but the enforceable right remains the same.” The consent order accordingly does not have the effect of eliminating the contractual basis thereof. Rather, through operation of the res judicata principle, the judgment constitutes a bar to any action or proceedings on the underlying settlement agreement. The provisions of the agreement are instead to be enforced by the remedies available to a judgment creditor on a judgment. It is of course always open to the parties to abandon the judgment in whole or in part and to enter into a new agreement. Save for the aforegoing, the effect of the consent order is otherwise that it renders the issues between the parties in relation to their proprietary rights and the payment of maintenance to a former spouse, where the agreement includes a non-variation clause, res judicata, and thus effectively achieves a “clean break” as envisaged by the scheme of the Divorce Act.’ See further rule 42 and the notes thereto below.",

    "text": "‘There may be cases where there is clearly no merit in the submission that the common law should be developed to provide relief to the plaintiff. In such circumstances absolution should be granted. But where the factual situation is complex and the legal position uncertain, the interests of justice will often better be served by the exercise of the discretion that the trial Judge has to refuse absolution. If this is done, the facts on which the decision has to be made can be determined after hearing all the evidence, and the decision can be given in the light of all the circumstances of the case, with due regard to all relevant factors. This has the merit of avoiding the determination of issues on the basis of what might prove to be hypothetical facts. It also ensures that there is a full and complete record on which the dispute can be determined with finality not only by the trial Court, but by an appeal Court required to deal with the matter. This may curtail rather than prolong litigation.’",
