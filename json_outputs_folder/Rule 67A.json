The rule addresses itself only to awards of costs as between party and party. Its purpose is ‘to permit a court to exercise control over the maximum rate at which counsel’s fees can be recovered under such an award’. The focus is accordingly on assigning a maximum value that may be recovered in respect of the work done in the 3 presentation of the case before court. The rule ‘contains a potentially sophisticated mechanism for placing a value on advocacy. Although it has no direct impact on what counsel will be able to recover from their attorney or client, it has the potential to send a message to the parties about the importance of their case, and how artfully and ethically counsel for the 4 winning side has pressed the case entrusted to them’.",

    "text": "arises whether it is for the court or the taxing master to decide whether the maximum amount, or a lower amount than the maximum amount, is allowed. The wording of rule 67A(3)(a) seems to provide the answer: the costs order made by the court must only indicate the ‘scale in terms of rule 69, under which costs have been granted’. It does not require of the court also to indicate in its order whether the maximum amount or a lower amount than the maximum one in the scale is allowed. Thus, it seems as if the taxing master retains a discretion to determine what the reasonable amount within the parameters of the scale should be. That would also be the position if scale A is applicable in terms of rule 67A(3)(c), namely where the scale of fees is not indicated in the court order. In the notes that follow reference is made to advocates/counsel only. Pursuant to the substitution of rule 69 referred to above these notes also apply to attorneys having the right to appear in the superior courts, and the notes should therefore be read and applied accordingly. Under the new dispensation a party who is dissatisfied with a ruling of the taxing master as to any item or part of an item in the bill of costs which was objected to by such party, or disallowed mero motu by the taxing master, could still under rule 48 require the taxing master to state a case for the decision of a judge. So too, it is submitted, if a party is dissatisfied by a ruling of the taxing master as to the amount allowed by the taxing master falling under the relevant scale, i e the maximum amount or a lower amount than the maximum one provided for in the relevant scale. But this excludes the scale of fees itself as determined by the court or falling under rule 67A(3)(c). A party who is dissatisfied with the scale of fees itself in the court order will need to apply for leave to appeal against the costs order. If the order does not state the scale of fees under circumstances that would justify the order to be varied as contemplated in rule 42, such an application could, it is submitted, be brought. Otherwise leave to appeal would appear to be the only remedy. There is no indication in rules 67A and 69 that they apply retrospectively. In Mashavha v Enaex Africa (Pty) Ltd it was 5 held that rule 67A, read with rule 69, applies prospectively: ‘12 It seems to me that the 12 April 2024 amendments can only apply prospectively. This means that a costs order under Rule 67A (3) should be made on cases instituted before 12 April 2024 but heard thereafter. The scale nominated in the order will only apply to work done on the matter after 12 April 2024. Take, for example, a motion instituted in 2023, in which written argument was filed in January 2024, and in which oral argument was presented on 15 April 2024. A party and party costs order on the “C” scale is made on 15 April 2024. The “C” scale will only apply to counsel’s preparation and attendances (if they are otherwise recoverable) after 12 April 2024, to the appearance itself, and to any recoverable post-hearing attendances. Fees for work done before 12 April 2024 will be recoverable under the rules applicable to the taxation of counsel’s costs as they were then.",

I am happy to accept that litigation is per s e important to the parties embroiled in it, but the facts necessary to draw the inference that this case is particularly important to Enaex are not on the papers. The second reason is that the importance of a case must be assessed objectively. Whatever Enaex subjectively believes about the case, the facts on the papers suggest that this litigation — a claim brought by a disgruntled ex-employee — is an ordinary business hazard.
