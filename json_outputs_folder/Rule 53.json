Similarly, a party who seeks to discharge an onus of proof which rests upon him by asking for an opportunity to adduce oral evidence or to cross- examine deponents to answering affidavits, should not lightly be deprived of that opportunity in view of the fact that such a 81 party was obliged to proceed by way of notice of motion proceedings. In Mamadi v Premier of Limpopo Province 82 the Constitutional Court considered the interaction between rule 6(5)(g) and rule 53 and, in particular, the question whether, in review proceedings brought in terms of rule 53, and after the applicant has obtained the record, a court may in terms of its discretion under rule (6)(5)(g), on the basis that the matter cannot be decided on affidavit, dismiss the matter without 83 rendering a final decision.

But where a case is properly made out, the disputes of fact are genuine, far-reaching and fundamental and cannot be resolved by application of Plascon Evans, the proper course in rule 53 proceedings is, in general, referral to oral evidence or trial. Dismissal without rendering a decision in these circumstances is inappropriate. Both rule 53 and the PAJA Rules render review by way of motion the default position. Determining a review application without making a final decision frustrates the purpose of expeditiously addressing unlawful administrative action. Put differently, where a review application is dismissed without rendering a final decision — so as to compel a litigant to proceed by way of action — this purpose is frustrated.’",

    "text": "to them. In reaction to the review application, the liquidators delivered a rule 6(5)(d)(iii) notice, simultaneously with their answering affidavit, questioning the legal competence of the respondents’ review application. The respondents riposted by lodging a rule 30/30A interlocutory application, seeking the setting aside of the liquidators’ rule 6(5)(d)(iii) notice on the grounds that such notice constitutes an irregular step. They also sought an order compelling the liquidators to file the record of the proceedings relating to the impugned decision in terms of rule 53(1)(b). The High Court determined that the only matter before it was the interlocutory application brought by the respondents. Having heard argument, it found in the respondents’ favour, stating that the full record of the proceedings was fundamental to the full ventilation of the issues raised in the review proceedings as contemplated in rule 53. It referred to rule 53(4), which states that, upon the record being made available, an applicant may amend, add to or vary its notice of motion and supplement the founding affidavit. Therefore, the High Court reasoned, it was not open to the liquidators to invoke rule 6(5)(d)(iii), as the review proceedings had not reached a stage where the applicants in the review application have been affordedthe opportunity to exercise their procedural right to supplement their founding affidavit in the review application in terms of rule 53. In its view, the question whether the rule 53 application was the correct and appropriate way to challenge the decision of the liquidators can competently be determined only in the main application once the required record has been produced. Accordingly, it concluded that the delivery of the rule 6(5)(d)(iii) notice by the appellants was premature. The High Court therefore made an order, amongst others, that the filing of a notice in terms of rule 6(5)(d)(iii) by the first to third and fifth respondents be provisionally set aside pending the finalization of the process prescribed in rule 53. An appeal against the order of the High Court was dismissed by the Supreme Court of 87 Appeal sub nomine Murray and Others NNO v Ntombela.",

Before ‘the action’ nothing happens. In the final analysis it is awareness of ‘the action’ that sets the clock ticking. The words ‘the action’ mean the ‘administrative action’, i e ‘the decision’ that is challenged in the review proceedings (Camps Bay Ratepayers’ and Residents’ Association v Harrison 2011 (4) SA 42 (CC) at 66B–C; and see East Rand Member District of Chartered Accountants v Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (unreported, GP case nos 64848/19; 46298/20 dated 11 April 2022) at paragraphs 33–44); Mohapi v Registrar Free State Transport (unreported, FB case no 2283/2022 dated 2 December 2022 — a decision of the full bench) at paragraphs [8]–[15]. In other words, the clock starts to run with reference to the date on which the reasons for the administrative action became known (or ought to have become known) to the party seeking review and not from the date when such party first became aware that the administrative action was tainted by irregularity (Aurecon South Africa (Pty) Ltd v City of Cape Town 2016 (2) SA 199 (SCA) at 207H–208A; Cape Town City v Aurecon SA (Pty) Ltd 2017 (4) SA 223 (CC) at 238E–239D; Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality v Asla Construction (Pty) Ltd 2019 (4) SA 331 (CC) at paragraph [49]; Sasol Chevron Holdings Ltd v Commissioner, South African Revenue Service 2024 (3) SA 321 (CC) at paragraphs [19]–[22]).",

In the latter case the Constitutional Court, however, found that if litigants are in certain circumstances required to bring review proceedings by way of summons, they will be forced to forego the advantages of rule 53 (at paragraphs [34]–[39]). In Steyn v Delport 1973 (1) SA 822 (T) the court condoned the fact that a decision of a magistrate made in excess of his jurisdiction had been challenged by way of appeal instead of review under rule 53. In Nelson Mandela Bay Metro v Erastyle 2019 (3) SA 559 (ECP) it was held (at 565E–567I) that proceedings by the State to review the conduct of its own officials on the basis of legality could be instituted by way of action. Consequently, it is not required of a plaintiff who institutes such an action to seek condonation for its non-compliance with rule 53 (at 568A).",
