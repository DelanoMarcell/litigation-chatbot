    "text": "In Mercantile Bank Ltd v Carlisle 40 the approach to be followed was formulated as follows: 41 The third party notice must be examined, as one would examine pleadings in an action, to ascertain whether it is excipiable in that it does not disclose a cause of action. If it is excipiable, then the joinder would be refused. If it is not excipiable, then the totality of the allegations in the affidavits must be examined to see whether the case sought to be made against the third party is so patently unfounded, notwithstanding that the pleading may pass the excipiabilty test, that it ought not to be allowed to proceed to a 42 43 trial. In Pitsiladi v Absa Bank, contrary to aforesaid, the view was expressed that a draft third party notice annexed to an application under subrule (3) is not a pleading, at least not until such time as the applicant has been granted leave as envisaged by the subrule. The purpose thereof is to satisfy the court that the applicant has a prima facie case vis-à-vis the third party and not that it constitutes a legally valid pleading. To dismiss the application on the basis that the draft third-party notice is excipiable would deny the applicant the opportunity to amend the notice and remove the cause of complaint, as he may otherwise have been able to do if an exception was delivered",
