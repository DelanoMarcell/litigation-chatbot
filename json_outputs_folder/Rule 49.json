(b) When leave to appeal is required and it has not been requested at the time of the judgment or order, application for such leave shall be made and the grounds therefor shall be furnished within fifteen days after the date of the order appealed against: Provided that when the reasons or the full reasons for the court’s order are given on a later date than the date of the order, such application may be made within fifteen days after such later date: Provided further that the court may, upon good cause shown, extend the aforementioned periods of fifteen days. [Paragraph (b) substituted by GN R2164 of 2 October 1987 and by GN R2642 of 27 November 1987.] (c) When in giving an order the court declares that the reasons for the order will be furnished to any of the parties on application, such application shall be delivered within ten days after the date of the order. [Paragraph (c) substituted by GN R2164 of 2 October 1987 and by GN R2642 of 27 November 1987.] (d) The application mentioned in paragraph (b) above shall be set down on a date arranged by the registrar who shall give written notice thereof to the parties. (e) Such application shall be heard by the judge who presided at the trial or, if he is not available, by another judge of the division of which the said judge, when he so presided, was a member. (2) If leave to appeal to the full court is granted the notice of appeal shall be delivered to all the parties within twenty days after the date upon which leave was granted or within such longer period as may upon good cause shown be permitted.

If not so directed by the judge president, the said registrar shall inform the registrar of the provincial division as well as the parties accordingly. (6)(a) Within sixty days after delivery of a notice of appeal, an appellant shall make written application to the registrar of the division where the appeal is to be heard for a date for the hearing of such appeal and shall at the same time furnish him with his full residential address and the name and address of every other party to the appeal and if the appellant fails to do so a respondent may within ten days after the expiry of the said period of sixty days, as in the case of the appellant, apply for the set down of the appeal or cross-appeal which he may have noted. If no such application is made by either party the appeal and cross-appeal shall be deemed to have lapsed: Provided that a respondent shall have the right to apply for an order for his wasted costs. [Paragraph (a) substituted by GN R2164 of 2 October 1987 and by GN R2642 of 27 November 1987.] (b) The court to which the appeal is made may, on application of the appellant or cross-appellant, and upon good cause shown, reinstate an appeal or cross-appeal which has lapsed. (7)(a) At the same time as the application for a date for the hearing of an appeal in terms of subrule (6)(a) of this rule the appellant shall file with the registrar three copies of the record on appeal and shall furnish two copies to the respondent. The registrar shall further be provided with a complete index and copies of all papers, documents and exhibits in the case, except formal and immaterial documents: Provided that such omissions shall be referred to in the said index. If the necessary copies of the record are not ready at that stage, the registrar may accept an application for a date of hearing without the necessary copies if— (i) the application is accompanied by a written agreement between the parties that the copies of the record may be handed in late; or (ii) failing such agreement, the appellant delivers an application together with an affidavit in which the reasons for his omission to hand in the copies of the record in time are set out and in which is indicated that an application for condonation of the omission will be made at the hearing of the appeal. (b) The two copies of the record to be served on the respondent shall be served at the same time as the filing of the aforementioned three copies with the registrar. (c) After delivery of the copies of the record, the registrar of the court that is to hear the appeal or cross-appeal shall assign a date for the hearing of the appeal or for the application for condonation and appeal, as the case may be, and shall set the appeal down for hearing on the said date and shall give the parties at least twenty days’ notice in writing of the date so assigned. [Paragraph (c) substituted by GN R2164 of 2 October 1987 and by GN R2642 of 27 November 1987.] (d) If the party who applied for a date for the hearing of the appeal neglects or fails to file or deliver the said copies of the record within 40 days after the acceptance by the registrar of the application for a date of hearing in terms of subrule (7)(a) the other party may approach the court for an order that the application has lapsed.",

(b) The left side of each page shall be provided with a margin of at least 35 mm that shall be left clear, except in the case of exhibits that are duplicated by photoprinting, where it is impossible to obtain a margin with the said dimensions. Where the margin of the said exhibits is so small that parts of the documents will be obscured by binding, such documents shall be mounted on sheets of A4 paper and folded back to ensure that the prescribed margin is provided.

Such consent, setting out what documents or parts thereof have been omitted, shall be signed by the parties and shall be included in the record on appeal. The court hearing the appeal may order that the whole of the record be placed before it.

(b) In the event of failure by the parties to agree on the amount of security, the registrar shall fix the amount and the appellant shall enter into security in the amount so fixed or such percentage thereof as the court has determined, as the case may be.

The appellant or would-be appellant may consider that the appeal had good merits and that it should not be mulcted in costs for the period up to the date on which the appeal became moot. The other party may hold a different view. As a general rule, litigants and their legal representatives are under a duty, where an appeal or proposed appeal becomes moot during the pendency of appellate proceedings, to contribute to the efficient use of judicial resources by making sensible proposals so that an appellate court’s intervention is not needed. If a reasonable proposal by one of the litigants is rejected by the other, this would play an important part in the appropriate costs order. Apart from taking a realistic view on prospects of success, litigants should take into account, among other factors, the extent of the costs already incurred; the additional costs that will be incurred if the appellate proceedings are not promptly terminated; the size of the appeal record; and the likely time it would take an appellate court to form a view on the merits of the moot appeal.

In Shepherd v O’Niell 165 it was held that there is much to be said for protecting a respondent in an appeal from an impecunious appellant who drags him from one court to another. On the other hand, to in effect bar access to a court of appeal because a deserving litigant is unable to put up security appears to be unfair and in conflict with the 166 provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. The court held that the conflicting rights could be adequately safeguarded were the court to be vested with the power to determine, in the exercise of its discretion, whether a particular appellant should be compelled to put up security and in what amount. To the extent that the subrule did not embody 167 such a power it was held to be in conflict with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 and to that extent 168 invalid. However, in terms of s 172(1)(b)(ii) of the Constitution the court suspended the declaration of invalidity for a period of three months from 30 August 1999 to enable the Rules Board for Courts of Law to effect the necessary amendment. The subrule was consequently amended on 29 October 1999 to empower the court that grants leave to appeal to release the 169 appellant wholly or partially from putting up security.",

I cannot see that it would be permissible for the Court a quo to go on to decide an application for leave to appeal itself after refusing condonation, or “in the same breath” as doing so. If condonation is refused, there is no basis thereafter for the Court to either grant or refuse the application for leave to appeal.

In SA Soutwerke (Pty) Ltd v Camel Rock Trading 520 CC (unreported, GP case no A124/2022 dated 26 September 2023) the appellant applied for, amongst others things, condonation for the late delivery of its notice of appeal and the reinstatement of its appeal. The application was enrolled before the full court which was constituted to hear the appeal. After delivery of the appellant’s condonation application, the respondent brought an application for an order that the appeal had lapsed. This was met by a counter-application to stay the respondent’s application pending the determination of the appellant’s condonation application by the full court. The respondent then sought a directive from the Deputy Judge President to the effect that its application and the counter-application could, as a matter of preference in the light of the imminent appeal, be enrolled before a single judge as court of first instance. The request was declined and it was directed that those applications also be heard by the full court of appeal. Eventually, the appellant’s condonation application was dismissed and the appeal was not reinstated. A costs order was made in favour of the respondent in respect of its application for a declarator up to the date of the delivery of the appellant’s counter-application.",

In Murray NO v African Global Holdings (Pty) Ltd 2020 (2) SA 93 (SCA) it was held (at paragraph [16]) that the Superior Courts Act 10 of 2013 abolished local divisions and constituted the High Court in its present nine divisions, corresponding to the nine provinces, with main seats in all of them and local seats in some. The local seats are not separate courts and it is no longer appropriate to refer to them as local divisions (at paragraph [18]).

If it appears that a court has not exercised its discretion judicially, or that it has been influenced by wrong principles or a misdirection on the facts, or that it has reached a decision which could not reasonably have been made by a court properly directing itself to all the relevant facts and circumstances, its decision granting or refusing condonation may be set aside on appeal (cf Prinsloo v Saaiman 1984 (2) SA 56 (O) at 61G–62A; Myburgh Transport v Botha t/a SA Truck Bodies 1991 (3) SA 310 (NmS) at 314I–315A; National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs 2000 (2) SA 1 (CC) at 14A–C; Baron Camilo Agasim-Pereira of Fulwood v Wertheim Becker Incorporated [2006] 4 All SA 43 (E) at 50i–51a; PAF v SCF 2022 (6) SA 162 (SCA) at paragraph [22]. In these cases it is stressed that an appeal court is not entitled to set aside the decision of a trial court granting or refusing a postponement in the exercise of its discretion merely on the ground that if the members of the court of appeal had been sitting as a trial court, they would have exercised their discretion differently. It is submitted that the same principle applies to the granting or refusing of an application for condonation.)

Practical methodology has differed. Some courts have required the presiding judicial officer to invite the parties to reconstruct a record in open court. Others have required the clerk of the court to reconstruct a record based on affidavits from parties and witnesses present at trial and then obtain a confirmatory affidavit from the accused. This would reflect the accused’s position on the reconstructed record. In addition, a report from the presiding judicial officer is often required.",

In Jeanru Konstruksie (Pty) Ltd v Botes 2023 (6) SA 305 (GP) the applicant contended that rule 49(13) was ultra vires the statutory powers of the Rules Board for Courts of Law and invalid. Following the Freedom Stationary [sic] decision (at paragraphs [17]–[19], [21] and [27]–[28]), it was held (at paragraph [29]) that rule 49(13) was not promulgated outside the powers of the Rules Board. The source for furnishing security for costs on appeal is the common-law authority of the High Court to regulate its own process, which is now provided for in s 173 of the Constitution (at paragraph [29]). In Dr Maureen Allem Inc v Baard 2022 (3) SA 207 (GJ) the respondent applied in terms of rule 30A for an order compelling the appellant to furnish security for costs. The appellant, amongst other things, contended that rule 49(13) was unconstitutional. Although the court carefully considered the appellant’s contentions (at paragraphs [32]–[58]), it ultimately determined the case without making any findings in regard to the alleged unconstitutionality of rule 49(13) (at paragraph [59]). The court concluded that under circumstances where the Supreme Court of Appeal, in granting leave to appeal in a matter, did not set a requirement that the appellant provide security and the respondent considered that it would be appropriate for security to be provided (as was the case before the court), it would be for the respondent to approach the Supreme Court of Appeal for an order to such an effect. Put differently, it would only be once the respondent in an appeal brought an application and obtained an order that it could then invoke rule 30A for want of compliance with the obligation created under that provision (at paragraph [67]). That did not transpire in the case before the court. The rule 30A application was accordingly dismissed with costs (at paragraph [[84]).",
