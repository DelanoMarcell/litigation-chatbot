At 9 issue was whether the court should allow the application to proceed as it stood. It was held that subrule (2)(b) compels a respondent to also file its notice as to whether it agrees to or opposes referral of the dispute for mediation. The rule did not suggest that the respondent’s compliance was dependent on the applicant’s filing of a rule 41A(2)(a) notice. Even if it were, nowhere in the answering affidavit was it stated that the respondent would have wished to explore or not explore the mediation process, but could not do so for reason of the applicant’s non-filing. The respondent could have complied with its part of the obligation in terms of the rule or communicated its stance on mediation regardless of the applicant’s failure. The rules were meant to be complied with, but they were meant for the court, and not the other way round. While it was ideal that litigants comply with rule 41A, in the interests of justice the issues raised in the application called for immediate resolution rather than removing the matter from the roll in order for the litigants to pronounce on whether they would agree to or oppose 10 mediation. The point in limine was accordingly dismissed. In Ethypersadh v Minister of Police NO it was, however, held that 11 an application brought on an urgent basis would of necessity not be subject to the provisions of rule 41A.",

During the course of the action proceedings he was ordered to furnish security for costs to the defendants. That he failed to do. The defendants then brought an application under rule 47(4) for the dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim. The plaintiff gave notice of his intention to oppose the application and simultaneously delivered a notice in terms of rule 41A(2)(a). He then sought an order for the referral of the case to mediation. The court regarded the plaintiff’s application for a referral as a 21 delaying tactic and held that even if the notice of mediation could be entertained, the court had no power to force 22 mediation upon the parties. Consequently, the court dismissed the plaintiff’s claim in the action with costs. 23",
