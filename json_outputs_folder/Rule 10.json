In a majority judgment of the Court of Appeal of Lesotho in Phakisi v Tlapana (unreported, Court of Appeal for Lesotho case no C of A (Civ)/50/2014 dated 21 April 2016) it was held, with reference to Bright v Triumph Garage (Pty) Ltd 1949 (3) SA 352 (C), that in an action where the eviction of the buyer of property is sought, and the entitlement of the seller to sell the property is attacked, the seller is a necessary party and should be joined. Farlam AP (Moiloa AJA concurring), however, held (at paragraph [6]) that this rule is subject to an important exception: Where the seller has notice of the suit and does not intervene to protect the buyer’s title (which the seller is obliged to do under the contract of sale), and the buyer is evicted (because the court holds that the seller was not entitled to sell), the seller will be bound by the judgment on the basis of res judicata (Voet 44 2 5; Paarl Pretoria Gold Mining Co v Donovan and Wolff NNO (1889) 3 SAR 56; Amalgamated Engineering Union v Minister of Labour 1949 (3) SA 637 (A) at 653–4 and 660). In such circumstances the seller is not a necessary party and a plea/point of non-joinder will therefore fail.",
