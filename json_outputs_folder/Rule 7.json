This method invariably resulted in a costly and wasteful investigation, which normally leads to the conclusion that the application was indeed authorised. After all, there is rarely any motivation for deliberately launching an unauthorised application. In the present case, for example, the respondent’s challenge resulted in the filing of pages of resolutions annexed to a supplementary affidavit followed by lengthy technical arguments on both sides.

The plaintiffs, in addition, raised a point in limine in regard to the first defendant’s locus standi. The court 19 held that rule 7(1) was concerned only with the authority of an attorney to act in instituting or defending legal proceedings 21 20 on behalf of a party. The court held, further, that in the light of the lengthy history of the litigation between the parties, the lateness of the rule 7 application was fatal. The point in limine concerned the question whether the litigation committee of the first defendant was authorized to instruct its attorney of record to defend the action and to institute a counterclaim against the plaintiffs. The court found that the committee was authorized and that the first defendant accordingly had locus 22 23 standi. The point in limine was dismissed.",

Authorization concerns the question whether a party is properly before the court in legal proceedings. Locus standi materially concerns the direct interest of a party in the relief sought in legal proceedings. For this reason rule 7(1) should be applied when ‘the authority of anyone acting on behalf of a party’ is challenged. Contrary to what was found in the Wilge Hervormde Gemeente case, the rule does not limit the challenge to the authority of attorneys to act only; the wording of the rule also contemplates a challenge to a general authority by one person to another to represent him in action or motion 24 proceedings. This is clear from the Eskom and Unlawful Occupiers decisions referred to above. Properly applied, this interpretation of rule 7(1) in motion proceedings should, in the words of Flemming DJP in the Eskom case referred to above, ‘lead to the elimination of the many pages of resolutions, delegations and substitutions still attached to applications by some litigants’.",

Where the party raising the challenge does so outside the 10-day period provided for in the subrule, it must obtain the leave of the court, on good cause shown, to do so outside that period. This would necessitate an application to court supported by a founding affidavit in which good cause is shown. This means, it is submitted, that the applicant should furnish a full and reasonable explanation as to why it is bringing the application at that particular stage of the proceedings and set out the nature and grounds of the challenge, and the material facts relied upon therefor.",

In Lancaster 101 (RF) (Pty) Limited v Steinhoff International Holding NV [2021] 4 All SA 810 (WCC) condonation for non-compliance with the 10-day period was given in the ‘interest of justice’ (at paragraph [45]). In Kaap-Vaal Trust (Pty) Ltd v Speedy Brick & Sand CC (unreported, GP case no 23143/2020 dated 18 October 2021) the applicant brought an application, which was opposed, for an order in terms of rule 30A to compel the respondent to comply with the notice served on it under rule 7(1). The notice was, however, served out of time. No condonation was sought by the applicant for non-compliance with the 10-day period. In dismissing the rule 30A application, the court, amongst other things, stated that the 10-day period was not merely superfluous. It was set so as to bring certainty to the litigants that no challenge would be mounted against their authority (at paragraph [19]). In Ensemble Hotel Holdings (Pty) Limited v Swanvest 328 (Pty) Limited (unreported, GJ case no 2022-058058 dated 6 February 2024) an application for condonation for non-compliance with the ten-day period was refused on the basis that the applicant did not show that its rule 7(1) challenge had any prospects of success (at paragraphs [12], [13] and [31]).

It is to be noted, however, that the courts have, in the past, tended to disapprove of the failure to give prior notice in such instances (Potchefstroom Board of Executors v Liddle (1891) 4 SAR 23; Western Province Bank v Du Toit (1891) 4 SAR 40; Barclays Bank v Coetzee 1933 EDL 7; Ravden v Beeten 1935 CPD 269). 45 In RML Lighting (Pty) Ltd v Vangiflash (Pty) Ltd (unreported, KZP case no 13682/22 dated 19 October 2023) the court pointed out (at paragraph [42]) that the respondent’s reliance on statements (in previous revision services of this work) that the challenge could be raised in an answering affidavit was misplaced in the light of the decision of the full court in ANC Umvoti Council Caucus v Umvoti Municipality 2010 (3) SA 31 (KZP).

In Van Zyl v Theunissen Town Council 1943 OPD 127 a letter addressed by a town council to its attorney containing an excerpt from its minutes was held to constitute a sufficient authority. In Eriksson v Hollard Insurance Company Limited (unreported, GJ case no 2021/45339 dated 24 January 2023) Strydom J stated: ‘[23] Rule 7(1) does not set out what evidential material should be placed before court by an attorney to satisfy the court that he or she has been mandated to represent clients, in this instance, the plaintiffs. It was argued on behalf of the plaintiffs that “satisfies” does not imply a burden of proof. In my view, a court will reasonably determine whether it is satisfied with the material placed before it to rule whether a mandate has been shown. The court will act subjectively, but as a reasonable judge which brings into the equation an objective yardstick. One of the reasons for a challenge to the authority of an attorney is not to be faced with a situation where an unsuccessful plaintiff, faced with a cost order, denies the authority of the attorney who instituted the proceedings. In my view, a court will consider the documents filed as proof of authority and consider whether, on a balance of probabilities, the attorney was mandated or not. [24] In a case where an attorney represents a corporate entity, a court would ordinarily require a signed mandate from an authorized representative of the entity in which document, an attorney is mandated to institute legal proceedings against a defendant. To establish the authority to provide a mandate, a court will require the resolution of the entity, which can either provide the representative with a general authority or a specific authority to appoint attorneys to institute proceedings against a defendant or defendants. An example of a specific authority would be where an entity has resolved to appoint a specific attorney to institute legal proceedings against a mentioned defendant. A party can challenge the mandate and/or the resolution. A court may, considering all facts and circumstances, be satisfied that authority has been shown even in a case of imperfect documentation being presented.’ See also Mahomed NO v Al-Al Shaik NO (unreported, GJ case no 2023/007716 dated 4 March 2024). 51 Mall (Cape) (Pty) Ltd v Merino Ko-operasie Bpk 1957 (2) SA 347 (C); Pretoria City Council v Meerlust Investments (Pty) Ltd 1962 (1) SA",
