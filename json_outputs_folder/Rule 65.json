The application, setting out the applicant’s qualifications and supported by a certificate of fitness, must be submitted to the registrar of the court concerned through the SA Embassy in the country where the applicant lives. The application and the covering letter from the SA ambassador are placed before the judge-president by the registrar. If the applicant is appointed as commissioner of such division of the High Court, the registrar advises the registrars of all other divisions of the High Courts of the appointment together with the commissioner’s address. Such other registrars then enrol the commissioner. The SA Embassy of the country whence the application emanated is also advised of the appointment.",
