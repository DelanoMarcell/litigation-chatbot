More importantly, the exercise of the discretion will be conditioned by whether it is appropriate and suitable in the circumstance to allow a deviation from the norm. That requires a consideration of the following factors: the nature of the proceedings; the nature of the evidence; whether the application for evidence to be adduced by way of affidavit is by agreement; and ultimately, whether, in all the circumstances, it is fair to allow evidence on affidavit.’",

Thus, in Uramin (Incorporated in British Colombia) t/a Areva Resources Southern Africa v Perie it was held to be convenient and in the interests of justice to vary the general trial procedure and receive the evidence of two witnesses, with their consent, from abroad via video link under circumstances where their evidence was vital to the defendant’s defence but both of them were no longer in its employ and not willing to travel from abroad to the seat of the trial court in Johannesburg in order to testify. In her judgment, Satchwell J included comment on the video conferencing procedures as they eventuated. The judgment is more fully referred to in the notes to rule 39(2) s v ‘If it appears convenient . . . make any order with regard to the conduct of the trial’ below.",
