Anyone else who seeks access must apply to court. This interpretation applies to all court documents and in all cases (not just documents produced by way of discovery or in terms of rule 53). It effectively seals court records which, at least before a hearing, would no longer be treated as public records. It does so without regard to whether their contents are in fact confidential or should be secret, or whether it in fact serves a public interest that it be available. The High Court’s approach to the subrule was informed by its view that the subrule is “an important administrative basis to support the implied undertaking rule”. The restriction of public access was so that “the effect of the implied undertaking rule would not be materially curtailed”. The High Court noted in its judgment that the parties had approached the matter on the assumption that once the pleadings had been filed at court they became “generally open to the public”. But that was in accordance with the then prevailing practice in the High Court.",

That requires courts, when interpreting a statute (or in this instance a rule of court), to avoid an interpretation that would render the statute unconstitutional and to adopt an interpretation that would better promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights. The purpose is to find a reasonable interpretation which saves the validity of the subrule. The subrule must be understood in the context of the whole of rule 62. Rule 62 deals with technical, procedural and oftentimes plain mundane matters. It is concerned with the preparation, filing and inspection of documents. It specifies the type of ink and paper that must be used; deals with numbering and indexing; and affords the registrar the power to refuse to accept documents that do not comply with the rule. It would thus be somewhat surprising that if the drafters had meant to drastically restrict access to court documents, they would have done so in terms of the subrule. In the context of the rule as a whole, the subrule is better read as doing no more than permitting the copying and examination of court records, which must occur with the registrar’s leave, at his or her office, rather than as a substantive prohibition on access.",

The amici submitted that there are several pointers that this is not only the only plausible — but also a preferable — interpretation of the subrule. First, the rules of this court, [fn70] the Constitutional Court, [fn71] the Land Claims Court, [fn72] the Labour Court [fn73] and the Magistrates’ [sic] Court [fn74] all state that “any person” may make copies of all court documents in the presence of the registrar (or clerk). Only the Uniform Rules qualify the phrase “any person” with the words “having a personal interest therein”. Yet there appears to be no reason in logic that would suggest that the difference in wording requires a different approach in practice in the High Court. The phrase “any person having a personal interest therein” is clearly capable of referring, as the other rules do, simply to “any person”. The ambiguity in the meaning should therefore be resolved by adopting the meaning that is consistent with the unambiguous intent of every other rule in South African courts on the issue. Second, this is how the rule has in fact been interpreted in practice. Prior to the High Court judgment, that was the practice in that court. With a few exceptions it remains the default practice in most, if not all, the other divisions that any person may obtain access to court documents. This thus appears the most natural interpretation of the",

    "text": "subrule. Third, such an interpretation, moreover, coheres with how the phrase is used elsewhere in the rules. The only other place the phrase “personal interest” appears is in rule 57. That rule requires an application for the appointment of a curator ad litem to be accompanied by an affidavit of a person who knows the patient, and two medical practitioners. If the person “has any personal interest in the terms of any order sought” the affidavit must disclose the “full details of such relationship or interest”. In addition the medical practitioners should be people “without personal interest in the terms of the order sought”. It is meant to capture those people who have an intimate or financial relationship with the patient. That appears to demonstrate that “direct legal interest” is not the necessary, let alone the most obvious, meaning of “personal interest” when the phrase is used in the Uniform Rules. In my view there is much to be said for these submissions by the amici. Textually, it appears the most plausible. It does not seek to give the term “personal interest” a stretched or unnatural meaning. It adopts the ordinary meaning that (a) is consistent with the constitutional right to open justice; (b) is compatible with the position in all other comparable courts as expressed in the rules and as given effect to in practice; and (c) fits with the other uses of “personal interest” in the Uniform Rules. Clearly, there is nothing inherent in the use of the word “interest” that requires it to be interpreted to mean direct legal interest. [fn75] Indeed, it is the interpretation advanced by the amici that best promotes constitutional rights. It is, therefore, the interpretation that this court should endorse. The High Court’s interpretation is inconsistent with the Constitution. It severely limits the basic principle of open justice, and the rights to public hearings, freedom of expression and access to information for the reasons described earlier. And it relies on a contrived textual interpretation. It makes the High Court an outlier, with far more restrictive rules of access than any other superior court. It should be rejected for all those reasons.’",
