I indicated that in the absence of the applicant continuing with the objection and in order to prevent an undue delay and a possible postponement of the matter, I would provisionally accept the documents but that independently commissioned affidavits needed to be uploaded to the electronic case file. I note, however, that although the respondents subsequently uploaded documents that purport to be affidavits by the second respondent and the first respondent’s director, the date of commissioning of the affidavits by the independent commissioner of oaths precedes the hearing of the matter. It is factually impossible for the content to have been confirmed as true under oath on 3 March 2022 before the independent commissioner of oaths and the mere appending of an independent commissioner of oaths’ stamp does not render the document properly commissioned. The documents are also not initialled on all the respective pages by either the deponent or the commissioner. Although the supplementary answering affidavit and accompanying confirmatory affidavit were admitted conditionally, the respondents did not utilise the opportunity to remedy the defect and as a result the affidavits delivered on behalf of the respondents remains [sic] defective. The statements were accepted but the probative value thereof is diminished by it not being confirmed under oath or affirmed.’",

    "text": "2 ‘Business address’ in this context denotes the address at which a person carries on business and not merely the address to which post may be directed so as to reach the business: the furnishing of a private bag number is, accordingly, not full compliance with the requirement of the regulation (Dawood v Mahomed 1979 (2) SA 361 (D) at 367). In Standard Bank of SA Limited v Redmond (unreported, GP case no 80438/2015 dated 2 June 2016) the certificate of the commissioner of oaths indicated that the deponent to the applicant’s affidavit appeared before the commissioner at ‘Johannesburg’ when deposing to the affidavit. The stamp of the commissioner of oaths which was appended to the certificate, however, showed that the business address of the commissioner was at ‘Pretoria’. The court (at paragraph [12]) rejected the respondent’s contention (referred to at paragraph [5]) that the affidavit was defective as it did not appear therefrom to have been signed before the commissioner of oaths. The court held (at paragraphs [10]–[12]) that the commissioner of oaths is required (a) in terms of regulation 4(1), to ‘state the manner, place and date of taking the declaration’; and (b) in terms of regulation 4(2)(a), to ‘sign the declaration and print his full name and business address below his signature’. Accordingly, the business address ‘has got nothing to do with the manner, place and date of taking the declaration which is provided for in the commissioner’s certificate’ (at paragraph [12]). See also Standard Bank of South Africa Limited v Barnard (unreported, GP case no 41826/21 dated 23 November 2023) at paragraphs [5]–[10]. In FirstRand Bank Limited t/a FNB Home Loans v Freddie (unreported, FB case no 4075/2016 dated 16 November 2016) it was held (at paragraphs [5]–[14]) that the plaintiff was entitled to file supplementary affidavits of the deponent to the plaintiff’s affidavit in support of its application for summary judgment and the commissioner of oaths before whom the deponent appeared, explaining that the deponent in fact appeared before the commissioner at Johannesburg (as stated in the commissioner’s certificate) despite the latter’s stamp having reflected her business address as being at Boksburg. See also Limpopo Province Voluntary Group Scheme Board v Mahubane (unreported, LP case no HCAA14/2019 dated 28 January 2021) at paragraphs [36]–[42]; Mndiyata v Umgungundlovu CPA (unreported, ECM case no 1606/20 dated 28 January 2021) at paragraphs [8]–[18] and the cases there referred to; Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd v Pit Dog Trading CC In re: Pit Dog Training CC v Likweti Home Owners Association (unreported, MM case no 2709/2019 dated 22 August 2022) at paragraphs [5]–[8]. 3 In Broodie NO v Maposa 2018 (3) SA 129 (WCC) an objection by the respondents to a further affidavit that the applicant sought to introduce on the grounds that the attesting commissioner of oaths’ qualification to commission the affidavit did not appear on the face of the document, as required in terms of reg 4(2), was not upheld by the court (at 136D–137B); see also Q4 Fuel (Pty) Ltd v Ellisras Brandstof En Olie Verspreiders (Pty) Ltd (unreported, LP case no HCAA 08/2021 dated 11 November 2021) at paragraphs [2] and [13]–[19].",

Regulations 2, 3 and 4 must be read as a whole since they provide for the manner in which an oath or affirmation is administered. The process follows a logical sequence which requires the commissioner to satisfy themselves that the deponent understands the nature of the oath; to administer it; to obtain confirmation of the taking of the oath by signature on the document; and thereafter to append their signature with details of place, area and designation. These latter steps are to occur in the presence of the commissioner. It is apparent that the entire process is envisaged to occur in the presence of the commissioner. The essential purpose of the Regulations is to provide assurance to a court receiving an affidavit, that the deponent, properly identified as the signatory, has taken the oath.

In Tambay v Hawa 58 it was held that ‘interest’ in regulation 7(1) must be given a limited meaning and cannot be extended to cover the remote and indirect interest which an employee of an attorney has in the matters dealt with in that attorney’s office. Consequently, a request for the dismissal of an application on the ground that the applicant’s affidavits had all been attested before an attorney in the employ of the applicant’s attorney was refused. However, where the attorney attesting the affidavit is the attorney in the suit, the 59 attestation is defective. If the attesting attorney is appearing pro Deo in the matter, he has an interest therein in so far as 60 he may succeed in getting his costs on winning: he is therefore debarred from attesting affidavits therein. It would appear that he would not have an interest if appearing pro amico, as no matter what the result, he would receive no fees; but the 61 onus of proving that his services were given pro amico would be upon the party alleging it.",

In Macsteel Service Centres SA (Pty) Ltd v Profin Trading 35 CC (unreported, GP case no 96119/2015 dated 17 June 2016) the affidavit opposing summary judgment was deposed to by a male person but the certificate of the commissioner of oaths read as if the deponent were a female. In allowing an affidavit by the commissioner of oaths explaining the error, the court (at paragraphs [5]–[9]) distinguished Absa Bank Ltd v Botha NO 2013 (5) SA 563 (GNP) and was not prepared to adopt ‘a highly technical approach to the affidavit’ (at paragraph [9]). In Tower Property Fund Limited v Fit 24 Gyms (Pty) Ltd (unreported, KZP case no 886/2021P dated 28 November 2022) the court also declined to follow Absa v Botha (supra) and allowed an affidavit under circumstances where any uncertainty over the gender of the deponent was erased when the commissioner of oaths himself deposed to an affidavit confirming that the applicant’s deponent, Mr ‘Rivaaj Singh’, had appeared before him and signed the founding affidavit (at paragraph [17]). In FirstRand Bank Limited t/a FNB Home Loans v Freddie (unreported, FB case no 4075/2016 dated 16 November 2016) it was held (at paragraphs [5]–[14]) that the plaintiff was entitled to file supplementary affidavits of the deponent to the plaintiff’s affidavit in support of its application for summary judgment and the commissioner of oaths before whom the deponent appeared, explaining that the deponent in fact appeared before the commissioner at Johannesburg (as stated in the commissioner’s certificate) despite the latter’s stamp having reflected her business address as being at Boksburg. In Standard Bank of South Africa v Mokoena (unreported, FB case no 4150/2021 dated 3 February 2023) the deponent to the founding affidavit in an application for summary judgment described herself as ‘an adult female’ but the commissioner of oaths in his certificate referred to the deponent as ‘he’. In dismissing the defendant’s point in limine that the affidavit was fatally defective, the court held (at paragraph [7]) that ex facie the affidavit it was clear that the deponent was a female and that the court was ‘satisfied that the error does not render the plaintiff’s affidavit fatally defective in the sense that the court would be unable to give effect to the presumption of regularity for the purposes of assuming that the oath was sworn to and signed in the presence of the commissioner of oaths’.",

The Radue case was distinguished in Nedbank Limited v Hattingh (unreported, FB case no 4136/2020 dated 7 March 2022) in which the objection was that ‘[t]he relationship between the deponent and the commissioner of oaths (albeit that she does not work for the firm of attorneys presently on record), is one where clearly they have a personal association of such a nature that the commissioner of oaths is an attorney for the Plaintiff in many other matters and on their litigation panel, and thereby clearly has an interest in the Plaintiff’s general business and the success of their litigation’ (at paragraph [11]). The court held that there was no conceivable basis on which it could be held that the attorney who acted as commissioner of oaths had an interest in the litigation, or that she would have wanted to, or could have influenced the deponent in regard to the issue at hand (at paragraph [16]). A similar finding was made in Swat SOS 247 (Pty) Ltd t/a SOS SA v Jones (unreported, GJ case no 2023-027536 dated 18 April 2023) under circumstances where the respondent’s answering affidavit was attested to by the wife of the respondent’s attorney of record who was a chartered accountant not in any way involved with the practice of her husband.",

I indicated that in the absence of the applicant continuing with the objection and in order to prevent an undue delay and a possible postponement of the matter, I would provisionally accept the documents but that independently commissioned affidavits needed to be uploaded to the electronic case file. I note, however, that although the respondents subsequently uploaded documents that purport to be affidavits by the second respondent and the first respondent’s director, the date of commissioning of the affidavits by the independent commissioner of oaths precedes the hearing of the matter. It is factually impossible for the content to have been confirmed as true under oath on 3 March 2022 before the independent commissioner of oaths and the mere appending of an independent commissioner of oaths’ stamp does not render the document properly commissioned. The documents are also not initialled on all the respective pages by either the deponent or the commissioner. Although the supplementary answering affidavit and accompanying confirmatory affidavit were admitted conditionally, the respondents did not utilise the opportunity to remedy the defect and as a result the affidavits delivered on behalf of the respondents remains [sic] defective. The statements were accepted but the probative value thereof is diminished by it not being confirmed under oath or affirmed.’",
