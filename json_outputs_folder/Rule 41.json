If the court doubts the authenticity of a medical certificate, the matter should be allowed to stand over to have the certificate verified (Goldman v Solomon 1924 (2) PH L23 (T)); a mere suspicion on the part of the court that the witness’s illness is pretended and that he does not intend to give evidence is no reason for refusing a postponement (Harris v Coulson 1926 OPD 91). A postponement will obviously not be granted where other witnesses testify that the supposedly sick witness is in fact well, notwithstanding the certificate handed in (Venketsamy v Muller 1924 (2) PH F35 (D), where the certificates were, however, unsworn).",
