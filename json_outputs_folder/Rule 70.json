It was, however, pointed out by the full court that it is permissible for an attorney to appoint a third party (which may include a costs consultant who is not an admitted attorney) to draft a bill of costs. However, when that occurs, the attorney must prepare a certificate that is to accompany the bill of costs in which the attorney certifies that the bill of costs has been properly perused and found to be correct and, further, that every description in such bill, with reference to work, time and figures, is consistent with what was necessarily done by the attorney.

The object is that the party to whom costs are awarded is afforded “full indemnity” for every expenditure “reasonably incurred by him in relation to his claim or defence”. It is expressly added that the object is also to ensure that “all such costs” shall be borne by the party against whom the order has been awarded. In order to achieve those objects the Taxing Master must allow all costs, charges and expenses which appear to him to have been “necessary or proper for the attainment of justice” in the case of a plaintiff (or the defending of his rights by any other party). The Rule accordingly requires that an expenditure of a type which it was reasonable to incur must be allowed. The extent of allowance must be on the level of what is “necessary or proper” in order to have his case duly presented. It is not for a Court charged with the merits or the determination of liability for costs to compensate for a perceived inadequacy in the operation of the Rule by awarding costs on an attorney and client scale so that a “full indemnity” of more comprehensive scope is achieved than the one which the Rule-maker envisaged.’",

Thus, for example, a litigant should not be restricted in his choice of attorney by the arbitrary nature of municipal boundaries: if an attorney lives conveniently near to a litigant or if the litigant lives conveniently near to the attorney’s offices then the litigant cannot be denied the right to consult that 144 attorney merely because a municipal boundary separates the two places. Similarly, a company with branches countrywide is entitled to instruct attorneys where its registered head office is situated even if the cause of action had arisen at one of its branches, its principal place of business within the area of jurisdiction of another division of the High Court, and the litigation 145 was conducted in that court. In this regard a distinction must be drawn between the case where the work performed by the local attorney is to be accepted as having been necessarily performed and the case where, by reason of the fact that the litigant could as well have given instructions direct to the attorney at the seat of the court, the work done by the local attorney cannot be classed as work necessarily done. It is in applying this distinction that a realistic and common-sense 146 Thus, it was held in Zeelie v General Accident approach must be applied and each case decided on its own facts. 147 Insurance Co Ltd that where a litigant who resides in one town but is employed in another which is the seat of the court can with equal facility instruct an attorney in either town, he should instruct an attorney where he is employed.",

The Tariff of Fees introduced by GN R1557 of 20 September 1996 with effect from 21 October 1996 (and subsequently amended from time to time) differs in principle from previous Tariffs. In the past, an attorney was allowed a fee for a particular kind of word done, and often the fee ranged from a low to a high, the actual fee allowed on taxation ultimately being in the discretion of the taxing master. Thus, for example, for taking instructions to institute or defend any proceeding, the Tariff allowed a fee ranging from R25,00 to R250,00. The present tariff is time-based, i e an attorney or candidate attorney is allowed a fee for the time spent on performing a particular task. The basic unit is R328.00 per quarter of an hour or part thereof for an attorney (i e R1312.00 per hour), and R102.00 per quarter of an hour or part thereof for a candidate attorney (i e R408.00 per hour). For example, in the present tariff an attorney is allowed a fee in accordance with the prescribed time rate for consultation with a client to institute or defend an action.",

Neither the common law, nor the case law, nor any statutory provision or rule of court, provides that an application to set aside/rescind a taxation award automatically suspends the execution of the underlying judgment. By way of analogy, an application for the rescission of a court order does not automatically suspend its execution. The remedy lies in rule 45A (see, for example, Peach v Kudjoe (unreported, GP case no 2016/30120 dated 10 January 2018) at paragraphs [10]– [16]; Pine Glow Investments (Pty) Ltd v Brick-on-Brick Property 2019 (4) SA 75 (MN)). Obviously, once the taxation award is set aside, the basis upon which the writ was issued no longer exists and the writ could be set aside.",
