This must, however, be done with circumspection. See also Tau v Mashaba 2020 (5) SA 135 (SCA) at paragraphs [13]–[15]. In Koch & Kruger Brokers CC v Financial Sector Conduct Authority 2023 (11) BCLR 1329 (CC) the Constitutional Court (per Rogers J), at paragraph [29] footnote [14], passed over ‘the question whether a separation of issues is permissible in motion proceedings’, referring to the fact that ‘[t]his was questioned in one of the judgments in Ascendis Animal Health (Pty) Limited v Merck Sharpe Dohme Corporation [2019] ZACC 41; 2020 (1) SA 327 (CC); 2020 (1) BCLR 1 (CC) at para 77, on the basis that rule 33(4) only applies to actions’.",

In terms of paragraph 22 of the Practice Manual: Natal (see Volume 3, Part I2) a matter will be regarded as partly heard before a judge who granted an order for separation of issues in terms of rule 33(4). Should that judge not be available at the resumed hearing of the trial, and provided the parties agree thereto in writing, the matter may proceed before another judge. Should the latter judge, however, not be satisfied that his decision will not depend on the credibility of any witness whose credibility was also in issue at the first hearing, the second hearing will have to proceed before the first judge. It is submitted that the aforesaid practice should, as a general rule, be followed in other divisions of the High Court. It accords with the principles relating to part-heard matters in general (see, for example, P Lorillard Co v Rembrandt Tobacco Co (Overseas) Ltd 1967 (4) SA 353 (T) at 355A).

In the FirstRand Bank case evidence of relevant and admissible context, including the circumstances in which an agreement came into being, was crucial. However, the parties failed to place agreed facts before the court (by way of rule 33(1)) or to lead any evidence. At the commencement of the trial they merely agreed to deal with the question whether the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 was applicable to their agreement. No order was made separating the issues, and the issue to be determined was not stated at all nor raised in the pleadings. On appeal it was held (at 307H–I) that the issue could not have been properly decided on the basis it was dealt with in the court a quo. Consequently, the eventual order of the court a quo was set aside and substituted by the following (at 308B):",

    "text": "court held (at 477G–H) that the facts of each case must be taken into account and that in the case before it the plaintiff’s injuries were not so severe that he would undoubtedly recover costs on the High Court scale, notwithstanding that the amount of his claim was far in excess of the jurisdiction of the magistrate’s court. The question of costs was, therefore, reserved for final determination once the quantum had been resolved. In Maguru v Road Accident Fund 2020 (3) SA 225 (LT) it was held (at paragraphs [16]–[19]) that the issue whether the costs in a damages claim against the Road Accident Fund should be on the High Court or magistrates’ courts scale was best suited to be argued during quantum proceedings. The danger of awarding costs on a High Court scale after only the merits had been settled, was that it might happen that at the quantum stage the award might be on a magistrates’ courts scale, and it could be found that it was unreasonable or unnecessary of the plaintiff to have instituted proceedings in the High Court. In that situation the taxing master would have no discretion up to when the merits were settled but to tax the plaintiff’s bill on a High Court scale, as that would be by virtue of the order of court made pursuant to the settlement, despite the court’s finding in the quantum proceedings that the action should have been instituted in the lower court.",
