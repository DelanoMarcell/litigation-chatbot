The defendant should therefore be careful to see that the paragraphs not denied are either indisputable or do not conflict with the plaintiff’s case. It may be safer to deny too much than too little. Secondly, it is sometimes desirable as a matter of tactics to deny an allegation which is not in dispute in order to compel the plaintiff or some other witness whose cross-examination is likely to help the defendant’s case, which is really in issue, to go into the witness-box. It should, however, be borne in mind that such tactical denials do not always endear themselves to the court, nor do they always achieve the desired result. 59",

    "text": "Subrule (4): ‘If by reason of any claim in reconvention . . . the plaintiff’s claim will be extinguished.’ A defendant who is in the position that he must admit the claim against him but who has an unliquidated counterclaim which is not capable of set-off, is faced with a dilemma. If he admits the claim against him, he cannot in his plea set off his claim against his admitted indebtedness until his claim is liquidated. In order to liquidate it, he must bring an action against the plaintiff. If the action is brought as a separate action, the plaintiff will be able to obtain a judgment against him on the admitted claim, which the defendant will have to satisfy even though ultimately he establishes that the plaintiff was at all times indebted to him on balance. In this way his credit may be seriously injured although in reality the plaintiff might owe him considerably more than he is ordered to pay to the plaintiff. Moreover, the plaintiff might be a man of straw and by the time the defendant obtains his judgment on the claim in reconvention, it might be impossible to recover anything and his judgment would be 123 valueless. One way of meeting this problem is for the court to permit the plaintiff to enter judgment against the defendant before adjudication on the defendant’s claim, but to stay execution until the defendant’s claim has been determined. A more common practice is that which has found recognition in this subrule. The subrule accords a defendant, who has filed a claim in reconvention (‘counterclaim’), the right to request postponement of judgment on such part of the claim as admitted by him until the counterclaim",

The court, however, embarked on an unnecessary discussion whether, in principle, a special plea or an exception is the appropriate procedure to raise a defence, and came to the following conclusion in regard to the view that 253 prescription should be raised by way of special plea and not by way of exception:",

In Dinath v Breedt 1966 (3) SA 712 (T), an ejectment action, there was no denial of ownership in the plea and it was held that the action fell to be decided on the footing that the plaintiff was the owner of the property at the time of issue of the summons notwithstanding the fact that it was known to the court that the plaintiff was not the owner of the property. At 718 Colman J states: ‘We have no discretion to disregard the admission of ownership in the pleadings before us.’",

It is submitted that it is the duty of the court to determine what are the real issues between the parties and, provided no prejudice is caused to either party, to decide the case on these real issues. Thus, where an uneducated woman defended in person and did not plead any defence, but a defence appeared from her evidence, she was allowed the benefit of it (Cohen v Coetzee 1912 EDL 305). Where a defence (consent) had not been pleaded in the court of first instance, but the plaintiff had taken no objection to evidence of consent being heard and had dealt with it in cross-examination, a judgment based upon the fact that consent had been established was upheld on appeal (Bredenkamp v Du Toit 1924 GWL 15). In Segal v Pein & Co 1924 GWL 41, it was assumed ‘for the sake of argument’ that a point not pleaded and not dealt with in the lower court, because the facts came out only at the trial, could be used on appeal. No decision was given on the point, however.",

In Builders Ltd v Union Government (Minister of Finance) 1928 AD 46 at 53 Curlewis JA stated: ‘A plea should be clear and unequivocal, it should not leave one guessing as to what it means.’ For a model plea, see Mabaso v Felix 1981 (3) SA 865 (A) at 875 and, in general, Amler’s Precedents of Pleadings. 81 Thomas Ltd v May 1952 (3) SA 750 (SR). 82 FPS Ltd v Trident Construction (Pty) Ltd 1989 (3) SA 537 (A) at 541H–542D; Bravospan 252 CC v Greater Tzaneen Municipality (unreported, LP case no 393/2018 dated 2 February 2021) at paragraph [25], overruled on appeal, but not on this point, in Greater Tzaneen Municipality v Bravospan 252 CC (unreported, SCA case no 428/2021 dated 7 November 2022). 83 For example, where a defendant complained that she had been underpaid by the plaintiff, but failed to set out the grounds upon which she relied in order to establish such underpayment, or the items in respect of which she had been underpaid, or the extent of the alleged underpayment, her plea was dismissed as not complying with the rule (Segall & Co v Becker 1927 EDL 113). 84 Clulee v McArthur, Atkins & Co (1907) 29 NLR 487; Lazarus v Kemp (1915) 36 NLR 504; Kruger v Symington NO 1958 (2) SA 128 (O). 85 Bokaba v Makona 1930 (2) PH F135 (T); Von Ziegler v Superior Furniture Manufacturers (Pty) Ltd 1962 (3) SA 399 (T) at 411. 86 Strydom v Coach Motors (Edms) Bpk 1975 (4) SA 838 (T); and see Von Ziegler v Superior Furniture Manufacturers (Pty) Ltd 1962 (3) SA 399 (T) at 410. 87 Jones v Hamilton & Haw (1886) 5 EDC 222. In Van Biljoen v Botha 1952 (3) SA 494 (O) it was said that, although ordinarily evidence should not be pleaded, this may be done where it is essential to inform the other party of the case he has to meet. 88 The pleading of irrelevant matter may make the plea vague and embarrassing, but where irrelevant matter is pleaded as history, this consequence does not follow (Du Plessis v Van Zyl 1931 CPD 439 at 442. See also Du Toit v Du Toit 1958 (2) SA 354 (D)). 89 Pleading 113. 90 Kilgour v Alexander (1860) 14 Moore 177. 91 This list does not purport to be exhaustive. 92 The plea should allege the particulars of the plaintiff’s conduct from which acquiescence is to be inferred (Van Biljon v Wilcocks NO 1930 OPD 134). See also Policansky Bros v Hermann & Canard 1911 TPD 319 at 1278–9; Burnkloof Caterers (Pty) Ltd v Horseshoe Caterers (Green Point) (Pty) Ltd 1974 (2) SA 125 (C) at 136H–137B; Safari Surf Shop CC v Heavywater [1996] 4 All SA 316 (D) at 323i–j; Botha v White 2004 (3) SA 184 (T) at 192D–193H. The doctrine of peremption (i e acquiescence) has been extended to applications for rescission of default judgment (Hlatshwayo v Mare and Deas 1912 AD 242; Sparks v David Polliack & Co (Pty) Ltd 1963 (2) SA 491 (T) at 496D–F); and see Zuma v Secretary of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector Including Organs of State 2021 (11) BCLR 1263 (CC) at paragraph [101]. In Venmop 275 (Pty) Ltd v Cleverlad Projects (Pty) Ltd 2016 (1) SA 78 (GJ) it was held (at 92G–H) that there appears to be no reason, either in policy or in principle, not to apply the doctrine of peremption to the right to set aside an arbitration award. In other words, a party who has acquiesced in the award is taken to have perempted any right to set the award aside. In New Media Publishing (Pty) Ltd v Eating Out Web Services CC 2005 (5) SA 388 (C) doubt was expressed as to whether this defence is still part of our law. 93 Fleming v Commins (1904) 14 CTR 879. 94 A surety wishing to raise the benefits of excussion, division, or cession of actions must not only specifically plead them, but must also raise them in initio litis (Rogerson NO v Meyer and Berning (1837) 2 Menz 39 at 48; Hurley v Marais (1882) 2 SC 155 at 160; Klopper v Van Straaten (1894) 11 SC 94; Ridley v Anderson 1911 EDL 13; Worthington v Wilson 1918 TPD 104). If the defendant denies the suretyship, he should nevertheless raise in initio litis the plea of non-excussion (Rogerson NO v Meyer and Berning (1837) 2 Menz 39; Mason & Co v Booth & Co (1903) 20 SC 645; Jeeva Mahomed v Mahomed Valli 1922 TPD 124; Moosa v Mahomed 1939 TPD 271). If the plea of non-excussion succeeds, the court may not necessarily postpone the matter to enable the principal debtor to be excused: in a proper case absolution from the instance may be granted (Oslo Land Co Ltd v Temple Nourse 1930 TPD 735). 95 Garde v Brink 1907 EDC 50; Doyle v Botha (1909) 26 SC 245. 96 See The Torch Moderne Binnehuis Vervaardiging Venn (Edms) Bpk v Husserl 1946 CPD 548. The onus is on the party alleging that a compromise has been effected. Compromise being a form of novation involving the waiver of existing rights (or those claimed), it must be clearly and unambiguously proved (Gridmark CC v Razia Trading CC (unreported, SCA case no 349/18 dated 25 March 2019) at paragraph 13]). A transactio is an absolute defence to the matter compromised, having the effect of res judicata. The object of a compromise is to ‘end, or to destroy, or to prevent a legal dispute’ (Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd v Swartz (unreported, SCA case no 1175/2022 dated 22 March 2024) at paragraph [18], referring to Western Assurance Co v Caldwell’s Trustee 1918 AD 262 at 270 and Estate Erasmus v Church 1927 TPD 20 at 26). 97 It is not necessary for a defendant to plead an apportionment of damages provided that the negligence of the plaintiff is put in issue (AA Mutual Insurance Association Ltd v Nomeka 1976 (3) SA 45 (A); Ndaba v Purchase 1991 (3) SA 640 (N)). 98 SAUK v O’Malley 1977 (3) SA 394 (A) at 403C; Brett v Schultz 1982 (3) SA 286 (SE) at 292D. 99 In cases where demand before summons is a condition precedent to the issue of summons, the plaintiff’s failure to send a demand constitutes a defence and should be pleaded. Where demand is not a condition precedent, it does not afford a defence, but can at most affect the question of costs (Booi v Blake 1877 Buch 113; Havenga v Lotter 1912 TPD 395; McMurtrie v Norton 1922 EDL 140; Reichman v Ysebrand & Co 1930 OPD 148; Hooper v De Villiers 1934 TPD 200, Feyt v Myers 1919 CPD 122; De Kock v Davidson 1971 (1) SA 428 (T); AMS Marketing Co (Pty) Ltd v Holzman 1983 (3) SA 263 (W) at 270). There are, however, certain exceptional circumstances in which a party who has come to court for relief against another without prior demand on that person will not be deprived of his costs (Tullis Laundry and Engineering Supplies (Pty) Ltd v Marcuson & Co (Pty) Ltd 1960 (1) SA 105 (T)). In those cases where demand is not a condition precedent to the issue of summons, the defendant is justified in refusing to pay the costs of summons if he satisfies the claim within a reasonable time after service (Havenga v Lotter 1912 TPD 395; McMurtrie v Norton 1922 EDL 140). A verbal demand is effective to render the defendant liable for costs of summons (Van der Berg v Tonder (1899) 16 SC 509; Livingstone v Cochrane 1908 TS 89; Geldenhuys v Visser 1914 CPD 336). The bare rendering of an account is not an adequate demand (Dougan v Estment 1910 TPD 998). It is not necessary, in order that the demand should be effective, that there be a threat of legal proceedings; all that the plaintiff need do is to notify the defendant that the debt is due, and that he requires payment (Livingstone v Cochrane 1908 TS 89; see also Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers of SA v Die 1963 Ambagsaalvereniging 1968 (1) SA 283 (T) at 287). Sufficient detail must be given to enable the debtor to know on what score the creditor claims the relief (Matz v Meyerthal 1920 TPD 338 at 341). If dies interpellat pro homine, demand is not necessary (Venter v Venter 1949 (1) SA 768 (A)). Demand may be made by post; but the letter must be prepaid and properly addressed (Goustyn v Van Putten (1898) 15 SC 34; Mechau v Van Jaarsveld (1847) 1 Menz 113). It is properly addressed if addressed as the defendant has directed; the fact that the address was wrongly given by defendant, whether wilfully (Chittenden v Schoeman 1905 TS 42) or negligently (Dougan v Estment 1910 TPD 998), does not vitiate the demand. It is not properly addressed if only the name of the farm, not that of the local post office, is given (Goustyn v Van Putten (1898) 15 SC 34). Nor if the address on the letter, though likely enough to find the defendant, is to the plaintiff’s knowledge, not that where the defendant habitually gets his letters (Agulhas v Dix & Hahn 1905 TS 292). A letter properly addressed and posted is presumed to have been received, but there must be evidence that it was posted (Smook v Dreyer 1918 OPD 1). The presumption is rebuttable (Essack v Smith (1888) 2 SAR 243; Van der Merwe v Colonial Government (1904) 14 CTR 732; Dougan v Estment 1910 TPD 998). No presumption of delivery arises when the letter is handed to a messenger (not being a postman) (Adams v Mowbray Municipal Council (1906) 16 CTR 371), nor when it is sent to a place where there is no regular delivery (Dyantyi v Warner 1909 EDC 342). It has been held that the word ‘presumption’ in this context means no more than that the fact that a letter was posted is evidence from which the inference that it reached the addressee may be drawn. In this regard all the circumstances must be considered in order to decide whether on a balance of probabilities the inference ought to be drawn (Goldfields Confectionery and Bakery (Pty) Ltd v Norman Adam (Pty) Ltd 1950 (2) SA 763 (T) at 768). As to proof of the posting of letters, see Zeffertt Evidence 222; and see s 7 of the Interpretation Act 33 of 1957. If such a letter was not in fact received, it does not constitute a good demand (Van der Merwe v Colonial Government (1904) 14 CTR 732, overruling Jones v Cauvin & Co (1891) 8 SC 217) unless the non-receipt was due to the defendant’s deceit (Chittenden v Schoeman 1905 TS",

    "text": "154 Daniel & Co v Siebert and Van Eeden (1892) 9 SC 31 at 33. It has been held that if one party takes legal proceedings, he thereby waives his right to demand arbitration if the other party does the same (Kantor Bros v The Transatlantic Fire Insurance Co (1892) 4 SAR 185; Riegler v African Lands & Hotel Co Ltd (1907) 24 SC 393). It has also been held that, if the defendant fails to apply for a stay of proceedings, he thereby waives his right to go to arbitration (Provincial Building Society of SA v P R Wade & Co (Pty) Ltd (in liquidation) 1967 (1) SA 121 (N) at 129). A party to an arbitration agreement who commences litigation instead of proceeding to arbitration does not, merely as a result of adopting that course, abandon its right to have resort to arbitration under the agreement. That being so, it is not open to the other party to contend that it has ‘accepted’ the resort to litigation by not itself seeking a stay, and that this ‘acceptance’ debars subsequent resort to arbitration. While parties can by mutual agreement put an end to an arbitration agreement, that requires the elements of a contractual agreement to be present. The act of litigating instead of arbitrating is not an offer in the contractual sense available to be accepted. Nor is the act of the other party, in failing to raise arbitration as a dilatory plea, or by way of an application for a stay, a contractual acceptance. The commencement of litigation does not preclude the claimant from invoking the arbitration clause in the contract. The party who commenced with litigation is free to abandon the litigation and proceed to arbitration, but is not entitled to seek a stay of the litigation whilst it pursues its claim by way of arbitration. Such party cannot seek to enforce the arbitration agreement while in breach of that very agreement: the commencing of action being in breach of the agreement to arbitrate (Aveng Africa Ltd (formerly Grinaker-LTA Ltd) t/a Grinaker-LTA Building East v Midros Investments (Pty) Ltd 2011 (3) SA 631 (KZD) at 639H–641A). The decision in Aveng Africa was criticized and not followed in BDE Construction v Basfour 3581 (Pty) Ltd 2013 (5) SA 160 (KZP).

    "text": "enforcement of the clause in question is raised. The mere fact that a respondent raises the issue when an applicant seeks interim relief as a precursor to trial proceedings does not, in itself, preclude a court from exercising its discretion to enforce the arbitration clause at that stage. This special plea is in the nature of a dilatory plea and the question cannot be raised by way of an exception even if it should appear from the plaintiff’s particulars of claim that there is in fact an arbitration clause (Parekh v Shah Jehan Cinemas (Pty) Ltd 1980 (1) SA 301 (D)). 159 Section 6(1) of Act 42 of 1965; Conress (Pty) Ltd v Gallic Construction (Pty) Ltd 1981 (3) SA 73 (W); PCL Consulting (Pty) Ltd t/a Phillips Consulting SA v Tresso Trading 119 (Pty) Ltd 2009 (4) SA 68 (SCA) at 71H–J; Aveng (Africa) Ltd (formerly Grinaker-LTA Ltd) t/a Grinaker- LTA Building East v Midros Investments (Pty) Ltd 2011 (3) SA 631 (KZD) at 639A–B; BDE Construction v Basfour 3581 (Pty) Ltd 2013 (5) SA 160 (KZP) at 162G–J. 160 The Rhodesian Railways Ltd v MacKintosh 1932 AD 359 at 370–71; PCL Consulting (Pty) Ltd t/a Phillips Consulting SA v Tresso Trading 119 (Pty) Ltd 2009 (4) SA 68 (SCA) at 72A–C.

Whether the matter falls within the scope of the deed of submission depends on the terms of the deed, which is conclusive (Rogers v Matthews 1926 TPD 21; Silpert v Seymour 1932 TPD 329), or upon the arbitration clause in the contract (Tyler v Phillips 1933 CPD 611; Meny-Gibert v Crawley 1938 CPD 491; Sell & Co v Pretoria Townships Ltd 1911 TPD 390). Thus, if the arbitration clause applies only to the assessment of the amount of damage, and the insurer totally denies all liability, the issue does not fall within the submission (Hurwitz’ Trustee v Magdeburg Fire Insurance Co 1917 TPD 443). See also Paley v Michaelian 1929 CPD 309 at 315–16; Scriven Bros v Rhodesian Hides & Produce Co Ltd 1943 AD 393 at 401; Enterprise Wholesalers (Pty) Ltd v Ebrahim 1954 (2) SA 262 (N); Turkstra v Massyn 1958 (1) SA 623 (T); Street v Dublin 1961 (2) SA 4 (W); Kathmer Investments (Pty) Ltd v Woolworths (Pty) Ltd 1970 (2) SA 498 (A); Van Heerden v Sentrale Kunsmis Korporasie (Edms) Bpk 1973 (1) SA 17 (A) at 27 and 30; Sera v De Wet 1974 (2) SA 645 (T); J C Dunbar & Sons (Pty) Ltd v Ellgood Properties (Pty) Ltd 1975 (4) SA 455 (W). 164 See the dictum of Viscount Simon LC in Heyman v Darwins Ltd [1942] 1 All ER 337 (HL) at 343, which was quoted with approval in Scriven Bros v Rhodesian Hides & Produce Co Ltd 1943 AD 393 at 400–1. Section 3(1) of the Act provides that an arbitration agreement can be terminated only by consent of all the parties unless the arbitration agreement itself provides otherwise. The cancellation of the contract pursuant to a breach thereof therefore does not terminate the arbitration clause (Garden Hotel (Pty) Ltd v Somadel Investments (Pty) Ltd 1981 (3) SA 911 (W)). If the arbitration agreement itself is alleged to be void and the arbitrator’s alleged jurisdiction is based solely upon that agreement, he will not have jurisdiction to consider that issue (Van Heerden v Sentrale Kunsmis Korporasie (Edms) Bpk 1973 (1) SA 17 (A)). In North East Finance (Pty) Ltd v Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd 2013 (5) SA 1 (SCA) the parties had entered into a settlement agreement containing an arbitration clause, and the issue for determination on appeal was whether the arbitration clause would compel the parties to submit to arbitration in the face of allegations that the settlement had been induced by the appellant’s fraud, i e whether an arbitration clause could survive the demise of the contract in which it was concluded. The arbitration clause provided specifically that ‘any dispute . . . including any question as to the enforceability of this contract’ would be referred to arbitration. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that it was in principle possible for the parties to agree that the question of the validity of the agreement would be determined by arbitration even though the reference to arbitration was part of the agreement being questioned — provided that they foresaw the possibility of such a dispute arising. Whether this was so would depend on a purposive construction of the arbitration clause itself and the agreement generally, having regard to the context of the agreement and what the parties probably intended (at 5F–6D, 7C–8A and 8E–9D). It was held, further, that the purpose of the settlement agreement had been to resolve certain accounting issues, and that the evidence was that the respondent had at the time of its conclusion not foreseen that there might have been fraudulent conduct by the appellant. There was thus no intention that the arbitrator would have to resolve issues relating to fraud, it having been envisaged that the arbitrator’s role would be to determine disputes in respect of accounting issues (at 9H–10G). Having regard to the purpose of the settlement agreement and to what the parties envisaged at its conclusion, it was therefore not intended that the validity or enforceability of the agreement, induced as it was by fraudulent misrepresentations and non-disclosures, would be arbitrable (at 10I–11A). The bank could not be compelled to refer to arbitration the questions of fraud and the bank’s right to resile from the agreement (at 11I).

In Sera v De Wet 1974 (2) SA 645 (T) it was held that the fact that the space for the name of the arbitrator had not been filled in the arbitration clause did not render it inoperative, because alternative provision had been made in the clause for the election of an arbitrator. 172 Schietekat v Naumov 1936 (1) PH A26 (C); The Rhodesian Railways Ltd v MacKintosh 1932 AD 359 at 375; Universiteit van Stellenbosch v J A Louw (Edms) Bpk 1983 (4) SA 321 (A) at 333; G K Breed (Bethlehem) (Edms) Bpk v Martin Harris & Seuns (OVS) (Edms) Bpk 1984 (2) SA 66 (O) at 70; Grobbelaar v De Villiers NO 1984 (2) SA 649 (C) at 658.

In the former case a claim for a hearing in court will ordinarily be acceded to (Metallurgical and Commercial Consultants (Pty) Ltd v Metal Sales Co (Pty) Ltd 1971 (2) SA 388 (W) at 393 and the authorities there referred to; Sera v De Wet 1974 (2) SA 645 (T) at 655; Scriven Bros v Rhodesian Hides & Produce Co Ltd 1943 AD 393 at 402). 176 Emdon v Margau 1926 WLD 159 at 165; Meny-Gibert v Crawley 1938 CPD 491; Sera v De Wet 1974 (2) SA 645 (T). 177 Baragwanath v Olifants Asbestos Co (Pty) Ltd 1951 (3) SA 222 (T) at 230; Elebelle (Pty) Ltd v Szynkarski 1966 (1) SA 592 (W).

In Electrolux South Africa (Pty) Ltd v Rentek Consulting (Pty) Ltd 2023 (6) SA 452 (WCC) the applicant brought an application for the final liquidation of the respondent in the Western Cape Division of the High Court, Cape Town. For that purpose it relied upon a letter of demand for payment in terms of s 345(1)(a)(i) of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 under circumstances where the respondent failed to respond to the demand for payment made in the letter, and was therefore deemed to be commercially insolvent. Prior to the bringing of the application the applicant has, however, instituted action against the respondent in the same court for payment of the same debt. The respondent’s defence of lis pendens in the application was dismissed on the basis that the cause of action in the action proceedings and the liquidation application were different (at paragraphs [9]–[15]).",

Without withdrawing that action, and on 19 October 2016, the appellant instituted another action against the respondent in the Free State Division of the High Court for damages he suffered as a result of a motor vehicle collision, which occurred on 18 June 2003. The respondent raised, amongst others, a special plea of lis pendens. One of the questions that had to be answered on appeal was whether, in terms of the provisions of s 2(1)(e)(ii) of the Road Accident Fund(Transitional Provisions) Act 15 of 2012, a claimant was required to withdraw his claim in the magistrate’s court prior to instituting an action in the High Court in the light of conflicting judgments in the various divisions of the High Court on the issue. The Supreme Court of Appeal was unanimous in answering the question in the affirmative and in upholding the special plea of lis pendens.",

This is so even where the prosecution was a private one (Eaton v Moller 2 Roscoe 85), and even though the plaintiff in the civil case received the fine imposed in the prior criminal case (Gagela v Ganca (1907) 17 CTR 359; Ganca v Gagela 24 SALJ 41; (1907) 3 Buch AC 102; Hornby v Municipal Council of Roodepoort-Maraisburg 1917 WLD 54; Van der Westhuizen v Raubenheimer 1875 Buch 37). The latter fact may be taken into account in assessing damages in the civil case. The record of a criminal conviction of a sexual offence has sometimes been held to constitute prima facie evidence of the defendant’s adultery in a subsequent divorce case (Christie v Christie 1922 WLD 109; Kleynhans v Kleynhans 1933 OPD 110; Dickason v Dickason 1934 NPD 97). The conviction of a person on a charge of theft is not, however, prima facie evidence against the same person who is sued for payment of the money alleged to have been stolen (Du Toit v Grobler 1947 (3) SA 213 (SWA)). 312 R v Lechudi 1945 AD 796. 313 Burnham v Fakheer 1938 NPD 63 at 67; and see Thorsen v Coopsamy 1936 NPD 636 at 641. 314 Paarl Pretoria Gold Mining Co v Donovan and Wolff NO (1889) 3 SAR 56. It is for this reason, inter alia, that the court will insist on the joinder of a party who has a direct interest in the litigation (Brink NO v Gain NO 1958 (3) SA 503 (C) at 506E). In Bester NO v Pieters 2023 (1) SA 398 (WCC) it was held (at paragraph [31]) that a party who intervenes as an ‘intervening party’ to existing proceedings and causes those proceedings to be postponed or stymied in order for such party to participate, cannot at a later stage claim to have not been a party to the proceedings merely because it chose not to file any papers. Such a party cannot approbate and reprobate. 315 1949 (3) SA 637 (A) at 662–3. This was reaffirmed in Kethel v Kethel’s Estate 1949 (3) SA 598 (A) at 609. 316 Kethel v Kethel’s Estate 1949 (3) SA 598 (A) at 603. 317 ‘An issue, broadly speaking, is a matter of fact or a question of law in dispute between two or more parties which a court is called upon by the parties to determine and pronounce upon in its judgment, and is relevant to the relief sought’ (Horowitz v Brock 1988 (2) SA 160 (A) at 179G–H.) An issue can be said to have been finally and definitively determined when it has been fully canvassed by both parties in the expectation of the court pronouncing upon it (Horowitz v Brock 1988 (2) SA 160 (A) at 180J–181A; Al-Kharafi & Sons v Pema and Others NNO 2010 (2) SA 360 (W) at 390F). 318 Bertram v Wood (1893) 10 SC 177; Hornby v Municipal Council of Roodepoort-Maraisburg 1917 WLD 54 at 56; Kethel v Kethel’s Estate 1949 (3) SA 598 (A) at 605; African Farms and Townships Ltd v Cape Town Municipality 1963 (2) SA 555 (A) at 562A; Hochfeld Commodities (Pty) Ltd v Theron 2000 (1) SA 551 (O) at 567G–568A; Holtzhausen v Gore NO 2002 (2) SA 141 (C) at 148E–F; Consol Ltd t/a Consol Glass v Twee Jonge Gezellen (Pty) Ltd (2) 2005 (6) SA 23 (C) at 45F–46A; and see Kommissaris van Binnelandse Inkomste v ABSA Bank Bpk 1995 (1) SA 653 (A) at 664D; Al-Kharafi & Sons v Pema and Others NNO 2010 (2) SA 360 (W) at 390F. If the cause of action is a continuing one, a judgment to satisfy the obligation up to a certain point is not res judicata in respect of the obligation thereafter. Thus, a judgment for one month’s rent is no bar to judgment for the rent of the subsequent month (De Wet v Jooste (1892) 9 SC 239; Maister and Shagan v Bernstein 1915 CPD 373). 319 Mitford’s Executor v Ebden’s Executors 1917 AD 682 at 686; Boshoff v Union Government 1932 TPD 345; Green v Coetzer 1958 (2) SA 697 (W); Bafokeng Tribe v Impala Platinum Ltd 1999 (3) SA 517 (BH) at 553C–E; Tradax Ocean Transportation SA v MV Silvergate Properly Described as MV Astyanax: MV Silvergate 1999 (4) SA 405 (SCA) at 417E–F. 320 Hiddingh v Denyssen (1885) 3 SC 424 at 450, adopted by Searle J in the court a quo in Pretorius v Barkly East Divisional Council 1914 AD 407 at 409. 321 Custom Credit Corporation (Pty) Ltd v Shembe 1972 (3) SA 462 (A) at 472A–B; National Sorghum Breweries (Pty) Ltd (t/a Vivo Africa Breweries) v International Liquor Distributors (Pty) Ltd 2001 (2) SA 232 (SCA) at 235I and 239F–H; SANDU v Minister of Defence [2003] 3 All SA 436 (T) at 444d–f; Molefe v Regent Insurance Company (Pty) Ltd [2008] 1 All SA 158 (W) at 159i–160e; Yellow Star Properties 1020 (Pty) Ltd v MEC, Department of Development Planning and Local Government, Gauteng 2009 (3) SA 577 (SCA) at 586E–H; and see Kommissaris van Binnelandse Inkomste v ABSA Bank Bpk 1995 (1) SA 653 (A) at 664D. 322 African Farms and Townships Ltd v Cape Town Municipality 1963 (2) SA 555 (A) at 562A; Bafokeng Tribe v Impala Platinum Ltd 1999 (3) SA 517 (BH) at 559A; Consol Ltd t/a Consol Glass v Twee Jonge Gezellen (Pty) Ltd (2) 2005 (6) SA 23 (C) at 45F–46A; Rail Commuters’ Action Group v Transnet Ltd 2006 (6) SA 68 (C) at 74E–F; and see S v Ndou 1971 (1) SA 668 (A) at 672; Minister of Justice v Bagattini 1975 (4) SA 252 (T) at 263–4. In the latter case it is pointed out that a judgment on all the merits is not required: a decision on one issue often renders it unnecessary to consider the other issues in a case, but the decision on the one issue is nevertheless a judgment ‘on the merits’. In Horowitz v Brock 1988 (2) SA 160 (A) at 179A Smalberger JA explained the difference between res judicata and ‘issue estoppel’ by saying that ‘[t]he doctrine of issue estoppel does not require for its application that the same thing must have been demanded, and it is the lack of this element which distinguishes it from res judicata’. In Smith v Porritt 2008 (6) SA 303 (SCA) at 307I–308E Scott JA explained the position as follows: ‘Following the decision in Boshoff v Union Government 1932 TPD 345 the ambit of the exceptio rei judicata has over the years been extended by the relaxation in appropriate cases of the common-law requirements that the relief claimed and the cause of action be the same (eadem res and eadem petendi causa) in both the case in question and the earlier judgment. Where the circumstances justify the relaxation of these requirements those that remain are that the parties must be the same (idem actor) and that the same issue (eadem quaestio) must arise. Broadly stated, the latter involves an inquiry whether an issue of fact or law was an essential element of the judgment on which reliance is placed. Where the plea of res judicata is raised in the absence of a commonality of cause of action and relief claimed it has become commonplace to adopt the terminology of English law and to speak of issue estoppel. But, as was stressed by Botha JA in Kommissaris van Binnelandse Inkomste v ABSA Bank Bpk 1995 (1) SA 653 (A) at 669D, 670J–671B, this is not to be construed as implying an abandonment of the principles of the common law in favour of those of English law; the defence remains one of res judicata. The recognition of the defence in such cases will however require careful scrutiny. Each case will depend on its own facts and any extension of the defence will be on a case- by-case basis. (Kommissaris van Binnelandse Inkomste v ABSA Bank Bpk (supra) at 670E–F.) Relevant considerations will include questions of equity and fairness not only to the parties themselves but also to others. As pointed out by De Villiers CJ as long ago as 1893 in Bertram v Wood (1893) 10 SC 177 at 180, “unless carefully circumscribed, [the defence of res judicata] is capable of producing great hardship and even positive injustice to individuals”.’ The aforesaid explanation was reaffirmed in Democratic Alliance v Brummer (unreported, SCA case no 793/2021 dated 3 November 2022) at paragraph [12].",

    "text": "and same relief which form part of the requirements of res judicata could be dispensed with where the same issue had been finally decided in the previous proceeding, viz the form of res judicata known as issue estoppel. A plea of issue estoppel could only, it was held, be permitted though, if it would not cause unfairness in the latter proceeding. In Douglasdale Dairy (Pty) Ltd v Bragge 2018 (4) SA 425 (SCA) it was held (at 432B–C) that it is impossible to provide a clear test as to what would give rise to unfairness. In that case the problem which presented itself was that the findings of the court a quo were not subjected to the rigours of an appeal (at 431I). The Supreme Court of Appeal, with reference to the Prinsloo case (supra), concluded that fairness demanded that issue estoppel should not be allowed to operate in any pending litigation because there had been no need to canvass the merits of the appeal as a result of a legally relevant new fact (i e the death of the first respondent after judgment in the court a quo had been delivered) and the changed legal position that followed (at 432B–D and 432G). See also Hyprop Investments Ltd v NSC Carriers and Forwarding CC 2014 (5) SA 406 (SCA) at 410B–H; Royal Sechaba Holdings (Pty) Ltd v Coote 2014 (5) SA 562 (SCA) at 566H–568A; De Freitas v Jonopro (Pty) Ltd 2017 (2) SA 450 (GJ) at 458G–J; Transalloys (Pty) Ltd v Mineral-Loy (Pty) Ltd (unreported, SCA case no 781/2016 dated 15 June 2017) at paragraph [22]; Wilke NO v Griekwaland Wes Korporatief Ltd (unreported, SCA case no 1327/2019 dated 23 December 2020) at paragraphs [16]–[20]. In the minority judgment of Wille J in Democratic Alliance v Brummer 2021 (6) SA 144 (WCC) it was held (at paragraph [28]) that a court’s authority not to apply issue estoppel for reasons of justice and equity (i e unfairness) must be assessed in the light of the principle that parties to litigation were required to bring forward their whole case and should not be allowed to relitigate the same issue by dressing it in different causes of action, i e the so-called Henderson principle (laid down in Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100 ([1843–1860] All ER Rep 378) at 114–115 (Hare)), which entails that — ‘. . . when a given matter becomes a subject of litigation — the court requires the parties to that litigation to bring forward their whole case, and will not (except under special circumstances) permit the same parties to open the same subject of litigation in respect of matter which might have been brought forward as part of the subject in contest, but which was not brought forward, only because they have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident, omitted part of their case’. According to Wille J (at paragraph [29]), the Henderson principle has been ‘fully assimilated into our law’ and ‘applies equally to pure claims of res judicata and to claims based on issue estoppel’. In Petersen v Gqosha (unreported, ELEL case no 1574/2022 dated 25 April 2023) Laing J observed: ‘[38] The Henderson principle must not be confused with issue estoppel. Whereas Wille J’s point was that the former must inform the application of the latter, the concepts are distinguishable. As this court understands it, the Henderson principle requires a party to present his or her case in its entirety, rather than subsequently attempt to litigate aspects of it that were previously omitted. In contrast, issue estoppel is a defence (derived from the principle of res iudicata) that can be raised when the same issue has already been adjudicated to finality between the same parties.’ If the relaxation of the three requirements of res judicata would lead to inequity, issue estoppel should not preclude a later claim that arises from the same issues (Prinsloo NO v Goldex 15 (Pty) Ltd 2014 (5) SA 297 (SCA) at 304D–306A; Hyprop Investments Ltd v NSC Carriers and Forwarding CC 2014 (5) SA 406 (SCA) at 412H–413C; Bravospan 252 CC v Greater Tzaneen Municipality (unreported, LP case no 393/2018 dated 2 February 2021) at paragraph [31], overruled on appeal, but not on this point, in Greater Tzaneen Municipality v Bravospan 252 CC (unreported, SCA case no 428/2021 dated 7 November 2022); Trustees, Burmilla Trust v President of the Republic of South Africa 2022 (5) SA 78 (SCA) at paragraph [43]). In Royal Sechaba Holdings (Pty) Ltd v Coote 2014 (5) SA 562 (SCA) at 566H–568A, 570D–G and 571B–E the Supreme Court of Appeal reaffirmed the requirements of a successful plea of res judicata and added that in appropriate circumstances the requirement that the parties had to be the same could also be dispensed with. An identity of interest between plaintiffs in two different actions is sufficient to satisfy the same-party requirement of issue estoppel (Aon South Africa (Pty) Ltd v Van den Heever NO 2018 (6) SA 38 (SCA) at 48C–49G; and see Bester NO v Pieters 2023 (1) SA 398 (WCC) at paragraph [31]).
