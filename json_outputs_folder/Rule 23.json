It has been held that it is doubtful whether this practice brooks of any departure; in the rare case in which a departure may be permissible, the court should give reasons for 41 the departure. This practice a fortiori also applies where an exception is granted on the ground that a pleading is vague and 42 embarrassing, a ground which strikes at the formulation of the cause of action and not its legal validity.",

    "text": "‘Within the period allowed for filing of any subsequent pleading’. These words, which appeared in rule 23(2) prior to its 177 substitution with effect from 22 November 2019, are not only nonsensical but also superfluous in the light of the fact that paragraph (a) of the proviso to rule 23(2) now provides that the party intending to make an application to strike out must first, by notice, delivered within ten days of receipt of the pleading, afford the party delivering the pleading an opportunity to remove the cause of complaint within fifteen days of delivery of the notice of intention to strike out (i e the notice to cure). A party who intends to deliver an application to strike out is therefore not entitled to do so before the period of fifteen days provided for in paragraph (a) of the proviso to rule 23(2) has expired. That paragraph technically provides for twenty-five days in total to elapse before the application could be delivered. The time periods within which pleadings subsequent to a declaration or particulars of claim must be delivered are dealt with in rule 22 (plea), rule 24(1) (claim in reconvention), rule 25(1) and (4) (replication, plea in reconvention and replication in reconvention) and rule 25(5) (further pleadings). These respective time periods are shorter than the twenty-five days mentioned above. Should it be required of a party to deliver an application to strike out ‘within the period allowed for filing any subsequent pleading’, as the relic requires, such requirement would be in conflict with the time periods stipulated in paragraph (a) of the proviso to rule 23(2). In the premises it is submitted that the words ‘within the period allowed for filing any subsequent pleading’ should simply be ignored. It follows that the application to strike out, which is interlocutory in nature, should then be brought within a reasonable time after the period of fifteen days provided for in paragraph (a) of the proviso to rule 23(2) has expired without the cause of complaint having 178 been removed. The application should be set down in accordance with the provisions of subrule (2). See further, in this regard, the notes to this subrule s v ‘‘May set such application down for hearing’ below. In terms of subrule (4) no plea, replication or other pleading over is necessary until the application has been disposed of. It is submitted that, as a general rule, the time periods for the delivery of a plea, replication or other pleading, as the case may be, would commence to run on the day after the order in the application has been made.",

In this case the defendants (i e the respondents in the appeal), in various exceptions to the particulars of claim, in essence contended that their predecessors either did not have the capacity to enter into the contract pleaded in the particulars of claim or were lawfully precluded from doing so. In reversing the upholding of the exceptions by the High Court, the Constitutional Court held (at 44G–45A and 50A–C) that the dismissal of the exceptions did not deprive the respondents of the opportunity to raise them as substantive defences in their plea and for the merits to be determined after the leading of evidence at the trial. According to the Constitutional Court it would be better to have the possible unconscionableness of state conduct thrashed out at the trial.

In terms of s 10(1) of Act 95 of 1998 no person is entitled to carry on the business of a home builder or to receive any consideration in terms of any agreement with a housing consumer in respect of the construction of a home unless such a person is a registered home builder. The prohibition does not affect the validity of particular home-building agreements, but disentitles unregistered builders from receiving or claiming consideration under them. An intervening arbitration award in its favour would not aid the unregistered builder, for the court would be precluded from enforcing it. Given the clear wording of the prohibition and the illegality it contemplates, equity would not enter into the matter (Hubbard v Cool Ideas 1186 CC 2013 (5) SA 112 (SCA) at 118H–J and 119G–J, confirmed on appeal sub nomine Cool Ideas 1186 CC v Hubbard 2014 (4) SA 474 (CC)).",
