To extend the doctrine of notice to such a situation would open the door to unscrupulous debtors to fabricate personal rights which would be difficult for a creditor to expose for what they are. It would also create, to the detriment of both the creditor and debtor, uncertainty as to the title obtained at the sale in execution and reduce the effectiveness of such sale.",

It is submitted that the court should, in the application of this subrule, consider all legally relevant factors, 12 and be satisfied that good cause exists for making the order. The Rules Board for Courts of Law, in framing this subrule, obviously did not mean that the court could without further ado grant an order in terms of the subrule. It is submitted that an application on the short form of notice of motion (i e Form 2), supported by an affidavit setting out all the relevant facts, and served on all interested parties, should be presented to the court. This practice could also be followed if an order declaring specially executable a judgment debtor’s immovable property under this subrule is sought in conjunction with a claim for provisional sentence under rule 8 or an application for summary judgment under rule 32. Once the court has considered the claim for provisional sentence or the summary judgment application, as the case may be, it could then proceed to consider the application for a declaratory order and, if satisfied that both orders should be granted, give judgment pari passu. If, in the case of a summary judgment application, the relevant facts are dealt with in the particulars of claim, a separate application and affidavit would be unnecessary, and the plaintiff’s affidavit contemplated in rule 32(2) would suffice. In an application for summary judgment in which an order declaring immovable property specially executable there is an onus on the debtor to provide the court with information concerning whether the property is his personal residence; whether it is a primary residence; whether there are other means available to discharge the debt; and whether there is a disproportionality between the execution and other possible means to exact payment of the judgment debt. If a debtor’s attention is drawn to the provisions of s 26 of the Constitution and rule 46(1)(a)(ii) in a summons, and the debtor completely fails to avail himself of the 13 rights that were expressly drawn to his attention, there is no obligation on a court to exercise judicial oversight.

Forfeiture provisions are, consequently, invalid. The mechanism employed to give proper effect to the rule should (i) ensure that the provisions of rule 46(11)(b) are properly reflected in the conditions of sale agreement; and (ii) require the sheriff to refund the deposit, unless an aggrieved distribution creditor wishes to apply for judgment to recover the losses from the defaulting purchaser, in which event the sheriff is obliged to submit an account for judicial scrutiny and comply with the judge’s pronouncement on the quantification of the losses. The sheriff must refund any remaining balance to the purchaser. The deposit must be distinguished from the sheriff’s other funds and placed in a separate trust account until, in the case of a successful transfer pursuant to a judicial sale, it is paid into the deposit account of the relevant magistracy as contemplated in rule 46(14)(a). Until then, placing the funds into a separate trust account gives effect to the sheriff’s function as a stakeholder regarding the deposit and complies with the obligations imposed on him under s 22 of the Sheriffs Act 90 of 1986. It will enable the judge, when scrutinizing the written report envisaged under rule 46(11)(b), to follow the paper 82 trail with relative ease.",
