Conditional payment takes place where the debtor pays an admitted debt, or an admitted portion of a debt, but in so paying purports to impose a condition on the creditor’s acceptance. Any such condition is invalid, for the debtor, in paying what is admittedly due, cannot engraft upon such payment a condition which was 15 not agreed upon between the parties or is not implied by law. This is equally so if the condition which the debtor purports to impose is that the creditor should accept the money paid in full settlement of his claim, and should forgo the balance, which may or may not be disputed. Such a condition is valid if the debtor is making an offer to effect a compromise of a disputed 16 debt, but is invalid if he is paying what is admittedly due. The creditor is entitled to disregard the invalid condition, to retain 17 the money paid, and to sue for the balance.",

In this case the condition is valid; indeed it is inherent in the nature of the tender. The creditor can neither object to it nor disregard it. It follows that if he keeps the money, he will be regarded as having accepted the offer and will be 20 debarred from proceeding to recover the balance of his claim.

In the exercise of its discretion on how costs should be apportioned when a tender has been made, the starting point for the court will ordinarily be whether the tender beats the amount awarded. This means that, apart from determining 72 the spatium deliberandi, the discretion at this stage of the proceedings is fairly limited. The usual practice is, if the offer or tender exceeds the amount of the judgment, to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff’s costs incurred up to the date of the 73 offer or tender, and the plaintiff to pay the defendant’s costs incurred thereafter. In appropriate circumstances the court 74 may make a different apportionment of the costs in the exercise of the discretion that it retains under the subrule. If an appellant achieves substantial success on appeal by obtaining an increased award of damages, the fact that an offer of settlement had been made prior to the trial which exceeds the award as increased by the court of appeal, does not affect the issue of the costs of appeal. The appellant who has achieved substantial success on appeal is entitled to the costs of 75 appeal.",

In Origo International (Pty) Ltd v Smeg South Africa (Pty) Ltd 2019 (1) SA 267 (GJ) it was reiterated (at 270E) that in order to qualify as a proper tender for payment, the tender must be unconditional and made ‘met openbeurs en klinkende munt’. It must be for payment of the full amount owing. It was held (at 271F–I) that although a tender to pay is a promise or undertaking to pay and not actual payment, it is not without legal effect. By way of analogy to an offer to settle and tender under rule 34, the tender for payment has the following consequence: should it be found that the admitted amount (or the lesser amount subsequently paid) was in fact the true amount owing, the party making the tender will be protected from the consequences of non-compliance set forth in the demand for payment (i e, in casu, cancellation of the agreement between the parties).",
