    "text": "General. It not infrequently happens that a defendant not only defends the action brought against him by the plaintiff but also has an action of his own to bring against the plaintiff. This cross-action may arise out of the same transaction that gave rise to the plaintiff’s claim or may be quite separate and distinct from it. In both cases it is desirable that the defendant, instead of being required to institute a separate cross-action with his own summons, and which proceeds eventually to a separate trial and judgment, should be allowed to link his action with the plaintiff’s so that in a proper case the two actions may be heard together, and so that judgment in the two may be pronounced at the same time. This prevents one party from getting a judgment against the other where the other has a claim which, when adjudicated upon in its turn, may compensate 1 and wipe out the first claim. The Roman-Dutch writers were emphatic that any right of action might be brought by way of 2 claim in reconvention. A claim in reconvention is, therefore, a convenient surrogate for an independent action. If a separate action were instituted by a defendant against the plaintiff, the actions could be consolidated, so that the situation would be no different from that which arises where there is a claim and counterclaim. The essence of the defence is that the two claims",
