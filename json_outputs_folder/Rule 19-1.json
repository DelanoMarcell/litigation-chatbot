Such person will have to issue summons against the plaintiff to recover 5 any costs/expenses incurred by him. If the person incorrectly served does not deliver a notice of intention to defend, and the plaintiff upon discovering the mistake wishes to recover his wasted costs from such person on the ground that he misled the sheriff, the plaintiff will also have to issue a summons for costs against the person incorrectly served. If the incorrectly served defendant does not make the mistake clear to the plaintiff (or if someone actually claims that he is the defendant and insists on proceeding with the action despite the plaintiff’s willingness to drop the proceedings against him) he will himself have 6 to bear the costs incurred by his foolish persistency.",
