A plaintiff who has made such an offer is not entitled to costs on an attorney and client basis merely because he made a secret offer which was less than what the court awarded. The court must still consider whether the defendant behaved unreasonably, and thus put the plaintiff to unnecessary expense, by not accepting the offer or making a reasonable counter-offer. Factors to be taken into account by the court are whether the defendant has engaged reasonably in attempting to settle; whether the plaintiff was offering a fair discount based on a realistic assessment of the case rather than holding out for the best conceivable outcome; whether the plaintiff allowed the defendant a reasonable time to consider the offer; the extent of the difference between the amount of the offer and the 63 amount of the award; and the nature of the proceedings and resources of the litigants.",

The legal representative of the party to whom discovery is made must have the opportunity to read and consider the documents, to compare the documents discovered with those in his possession, to consult with his client and witnesses in connection with the discovered documents, to consider whether there are not further documents in existence which should have been disclosed and to deliberate whether the court should not be moved to order further and better 175 discovery.

In the present case we are dealing with defamatory statements and defences such as truth and public interest or fair comment that might be raised. The question to be addressed is whether the documents sought might have evidentiary value and might assist the appellants in their defence to the relief claimed in the main case. Supposition or speculation about the existence of documents or tape recordings to compel production will not suffice. In exercising its discretion, the court will approach the matter on the basis set out in the preceding paragraph. The wording of rule 35(12) is clear in relation to its application. Where there has been reference to a document within the meaning of that expression in an affidavit, and it is relevant, it must be produced.

Ordinarily, strong grounds would have to be advanced to persuade a court to act outside the powers provided for specifically in the rules. Here, having given notice in terms of rule 35(12) that has not been complied with, it was for the School to give notice in terms of rule 30A that it intended, after the lapse of 10 days, applying for an order that its rule 35(12) notice be complied with.

At the very least, the children appear to believe that they will. There is nothing to suggest that their perception in that regard is not genuinely held. In those circumstances there is much to be said for the argument that disclosure of the questionnaires would not be in their best interests. That is not to suggest, to employ the language of Sutherland J, that the best interest principle operates as a trump, because, as the Constitutional Court pointed out in S v M (above [24]) para 26, “the fact that the best interests of the child are paramount does not mean that they are absolute”. It is thus but a starting point for any balancing of rights. Of course in appropriate circumstances and as part of that balancing act a court could endeavour to impose suitable conditions relative to the production and inspection.",

In the event, there was no justifiable basis for holding that the interests of the School in investigating the identities of the children in order to answer the allegations outweighed the interests of the children in not having their identities disclosed, especially in the light of the fact that the children had disclosed the information (which they otherwise may not have done) on condition of, and in the expectation of, their identities not being disclosed.",

The School could point to no prejudice to it. It further cannot be said that, if the CCL is joined in the application, this is not an appropriate way for the children to participate in the litigation. The court below held that the hearsay nature of the evidence adduced by the CCL required the disclosure of the questionnaires. The CCL adduced the evidence in hearsay form so as to protect the identities of the children, conscious that the admissibility and weight of the evidence would be considered in due course on the basis that it is hearsay evidence. The questions of admissibility and weight of the evidence were thus not issues to be determined in this application. The School obviously retained the right to oppose the admission of the hearsay evidence and to argue that it should be accorded little weight, if admitted.

    "text": "refusals, Moneyweb launched an application in the Gauteng Division of the High Court to compel the Nova Group of Companies to provide access to it for inspection and making copies of the securities registers within five days of the date of the order (‘the main application’). Instead of filing an answering affidavit, the Group of Companies issued notices in terms of rule 35(12) and (11)–(14) in which they sought documents referred to in Moneyweb’s founding affidavit. Dissatisfied with the response to the notices, the Group of Companies launched an application to compel compliance with the notices. The application revealed that the Group of Companies ostensibly sought these documents for purposes of interrogating the ‘real motives’ of Moneyweb, as they believed that Moneyweb was acting in furtherance of a ‘sinister agenda’ directed against them, including certain members of its executive, and that Moneyweb had embarked upon a vendetta for the sole purpose of discrediting them and undermining their integrity. The Group of Companies contended that the documents sought would enable them to prove that Moneyweb intended to publish articles in the media not for any journalistic motive, but rather in furtherance of the ‘sinister agenda’ referred to above. They asserted, in this regard, that the documents sought were relevant to the anticipated issues in the main application, as they would provide them with a defence to that application. Tuchten J granted the rule 35(12) application but dismissed the Companies’ rule 35(14) application. In dismissing the Companies’ appeal against the dismissal of 268 the latter application, the Supreme Court of Appeal held that Moneyweb’s ‘motive’ for seeking access to the securities registers was irrelevant and that the Group of Companies had failed to demonstrate that the documents sought in their rule 35(14) were ‘relevant to a reasonably anticipated issue in the main application’.",

A statement or admission made to a third party by the driver of the insured vehicle is inadmissible as evidence against the authorized insurance company (Union and SWA Insurance Co Ltd v Quntana NO 1977 (4) SA 410 (A)).",

In Astral Operations Ltd v Minister for Local Development, Western Cape 2019 (3) SA 189 (WCC) it was undisputed that a litigant is entitled to decline to produce a document demanded in terms of subrule (12) if it is privileged (at 191D). The respondents claimed ‘legal advice privilege’ and/or ‘litigation privilege’ in respect of a certain memorandum which was disclosed by junior counsel for one of them to the attorney acting for one of the applicants. The memorandum set out counsel’s advice on the development in a pending review application after receipt of the applicant’s supplementary replying papers and counsel’s recommendations as to how the respondents should deal with the resultant situation. It was found that the respondents had not waived privilege and that considerations of fairness did not require the disclosure of the memorandum (at 199I–202B).",

It has been held in England that a computer database which forms part of the business records of a company is, in so far as it contains information capable of being retrieved and converted into readable form, a ‘document’ for the purposes of Order 24 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and therefore susceptible to discovery (Derby & Co Ltd v Weldon (No 9) [1991] All ER 901 (Ch)). Joe van Dorsten ‘Discovery of electronic documents and attorneys’ obligations’ 2012 (November) De Rebus 34–6 correctly contended that, when compared with foreign developments, it could be seen that the wording of rule 35 pertaining to the discovery of documents and tape recordings did not adequately provide for discovery of information created, stored and retrieved primarily in electronic form, and that the rule had to be appropriately amended. The insertion of subrule (15)(a) with effect from 1 December 2020 seemingly brought the position in line with foreign developments.",
