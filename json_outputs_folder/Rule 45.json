It is clear that in order to execute on an undertaking in a settlement to pay costs, a judgment will have to be obtained and the costs will have to be 10 11 taxed. A taxed bill of costs alone is not enough to levy execution on an undertaking to pay costs. An allocatur does not 12 amount to a judgment for purposes of execution. In the absence of an order that compelled a party to pay the other party’s costs, the taxing master has no authority to tax the bill. If the taxing master does so, he acts ultra vires and the writ 13 of execution issued falls to be set aside for lack of a causa. There is, however, no reason in principle or practice why a judgment for payment of a category of expenses which can be quantified without difficulty should not be able to sustain a writ, if the accrual and the amount of the expenses, on the basis of which liability therefor is established in a judgment, are 14 proved, for example, by an affidavit of the judgment creditor.",

The common-law practice in accordance with the view of Voet is that wages can be arrested, but the portion of the wages that should be garnished is a matter that lies in the discretion of a prudent and 90 91 circumspect judge. In Pienaar v Pienaar the court considered the aforesaid conflicting views and held that the Foley approach disregards the discretion of the court and could provide an irresponsible practitioner with a drastic remedy while little or no protection is being afforded to the judgment debtor and, should the whole salary of the judgment debtor be attached, he 92 93 will not be able to support his dependants.

The former rule provides for the attachment of ‘other’ incorporeal rights, for example a judgment debtor’s right to moneys standing to its credit in its banking account. Importantly, rule 45(8)(c) does not envisage the attachment of actual moneys but rather the right to the money in the bank account. Like any movable property that is attached, the right must be realised by its sale at a sale in execution. Rule 45(8)(c) does not place any obligation on the bank in question to pay actual moneys to either the sheriff or the judgment creditor. Rule 45(12)(a), instead, contemplates payment of actual moneys. The procedure created by it is not that of an attachment followed by the sale of the attached property at a sale in execution. It creates a garnishee procedure, dealing with execution against debts which are accruing to the judgment debtor (MEC, Department of Public Works v Ikamva Architects 2022 (6) SA 275 (ECB) (a decision of the full court) at paragraphs [77]–[80]).",

The former rule provides for the attachment of ‘other’ incorporeal rights, for example a judgment debtor’s right to moneys standing to its credit in its banking account. Importantly, rule 45(8)(c) does not envisage the attachment of actual moneys but rather the right to the money in the bank account. Like any movable property that is attached, the right must be realised by its sale at a sale in execution. Rule 45(8)(c) does not place any obligation on the bank in question to pay actual moneys to either the sheriff or the judgment creditor. Rule 45(12)(a), instead, contemplates payment of actual moneys. The procedure created by it is not that of an attachment followed by the sale of the attached property at a sale in execution. It creates a garnishee procedure, dealing with execution against debts which are accruing to the judgment debtor (MEC, Department of Public Works v Ikamva Architects 2022 (6) SA 275 (ECB) (a decision of the full court) at paragraphs [77]–[80]).",
