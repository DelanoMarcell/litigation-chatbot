The burden of determining the amount is an onerous one to place upon the consumer, as the consumer may not be aware of complex calculations that are to be taken into account while calculating interest.

The better view seems to be that the intention of the parties should be conclusive, and that the prima facie interpretation should be that an agent of an unnamed principal is 152 not personally a party to the contract.",

A contrary position was taken in African Bank Corporation of Botswana Ltd v Kariba Furniture 257 Manufacturers (Pty) Ltd, where the requisite leave to commence proceedings was granted as part of the relief claimed in 259 258 the main proceedings. In Safari Thatching Lowveld CC v Misty Mountain Trading 2 (Pty) Ltd it was held that where already commenced legal proceedings against a company have been suspended as a result of the institution of business rescue processes, leave to proceed, in terms of s 133(1)(b), may competently be sought during such main proceedings themselves 260 and that a substantive, separate application is not required. In Booysen v Jonkheer Boerewynmakery (Pty) Ltd 261 held that it was not necessary that, in each and every matter in which leave of the court was required, such leave had to it was be sought and obtained by way of a formal application; or that such leave, of necessity, had always to be sought by way of a separate, prior application. What would be required would depend on the circumstances of each particular matter. It would in each case be a matter for the court’s discretion, to be exercised judicially on the basis of considerations of fairness and the interests of justice. Where the facts of a particular matter dictated that, prior to commencing with certain legal proceedings, a court should impose certain terms and conditions, it would obviously be sensible and proper to approach the court for the necessary leave and guidance in this regard, before such proceedings were commenced. However, there might well be instances where it would be appropriate, fair and convenient to obtain the court’s leave in one and the same matter, by way of an interim order, before the main application or action itself was heard, and the relief sought therein was granted. Examples would include instances where proceedings had to be launched as a matter of urgency, or where the facts and circumstances relevant to the principal application were inevitably going to have to be dealt with in any interlocutory application for leave to launch such application.",

The prospects of the prayer for leave to institute the legal proceedings would generally be heavily reliant on the prospects of success in the main relief sought.

    "text": "The general moratorium on legal proceedings against a company under business rescue does not encompass ejection proceedings against the company in circumstances where the lease regulating the occupation has been validly cancelled and the company failed to vacate the premises. This is apparent from the language of s 133(1) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, which provides that the moratorium applied to legal proceedings against the company or ‘in relation to any property belonging 265 to the company, or lawfully in its possession’. In its plain meaning the said phrase limits the reach of the moratorium, rendering it inapplicable to legal proceedings or enforcement action in relation to property unlawfully possessed by a company under business rescue. The failure of a lessee to vacate premises when there is an obligation to do so, which would be the 266 case where the lease had been cancelled, renders the lessee an unlawful occupier. The moratorium does not prohibit a credit provider who has cancelled an instalment sale agreement in respect of a vehicle, and obtained an order confirming the 267 cancellation and for the return of the vehicle, to execute the order for return of the vehicle. The moratorium also does not bar shareholders from compelling the return to the company of its property under circumstances where (a) the purpose of the s 133 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 is to protect the company and its property from claims by third parties (it does not deal with proceedings against third parties to protect or recover the property of the company, for the company’s benefit); (b) the interests of the business rescue practitioner are aligned with those of the third party; (c) the matter is urgent; (d) there is no defence to the claim for return of the property; and (e) the court, if asked, would have granted leave to the applicants",

Where it is already being wound up, whether provisionally or finally, that means that the persons on 277 whom it must be served, as representing the company, are its liquidators. It is apparent from the provisions of s 131 of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 that the company that is the subject of the business rescue application is entitled to oppose it. At the time the application is made in relation to a company under provisional or final winding up, its affairs will be in the hands of the liquidators. On ordinary principles it seems obvious that liquidators, whether provisional or final, faced with such an application should be entitled either to support or oppose the application depending upon their judgement as to the interests of the company and its creditors. As a matter of principle, when parties are cited in legal proceedings they are entitled without more to participate in those proceedings. The fact that they were cited as parties gives them that right. Where the liquidators were cited and decided to resist the application they were entitled to do so by the mere fact of their joinder as parties. It is not open to an applicant who has joined a respondent to contend thereafter that this was a misjoinder and on that footing to resist an adverse order for costs. Were that the case a party who took the point that they had been wrongly joined would not 278 be entitled to recover their costs, when that argument succeeded. In terms of s 165(5) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 a person may apply to a court for leave to continue, in the name of the company, only legal proceedings that had been properly authorized at inception.",

On 1 February 2022 the Estate Agency Affairs Act 112 of 1976 (‘the old Act’), which regulated estate agents, was repealed by the Property Practitioners Act 22 of 2019 (‘the new Act’). Under the new Act no one may act as a 519 property practitioner without, amongst other things, having been issued with a Fidelity Fund certificate, or receive remuneration or other payment in respect of or arising from the performance of any act referred to in s 1(a)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) 520 Under the of the Act without, at the time of the performance of the act, being in possession of a Fidelity Fund certificate. 521 or receive remuneration or other payment for such an old Act no one was entitled to perform an act of an estate agent, 522 In Signature Real Estate (Pty) Ltd v Charles Edwards act, unless they had been issued with a valid fidelity fund certificate. 523 Properties the appellant was not in possession of a fidelity fund certificate in its name at the time the disputed commission between it and the third respondent was earned. The appellant claimed, however, that it was entitled to be issued with the certificate, as it had complied with the requirements of the old Act, and that the reason the certificate in its possession contained a misdescription was due to an error on the part of the Board. The Board conceded this. The court a quo, relying on 524 Brodsky Trading 224 CC v Cronimet Chrome Mining SA (Pty) Ltd, held that the appellant was not entitled to claim commission in the circumstances. The court a quo’s decision was in conflict with that in Crous International (Pty) Ltd v 525 Printing Industries Federation of South Africa, where Coppin J held a contrary view",

    "text": "5 In Alberts v Minister of Justice and Correctional Services 2022 (6) SA 59 (SCA) the appeal arose from a combined summons sued out by 138 plaintiffs in the High Court under rule 17(2)(a) prior to its amendment with effect from 1 February 2022. Each of them claimed damages from the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services arising from an alleged assault on each particular plaintiff at St Albans Medium B Correctional Centre on 1 and 2 March 2014. The assaults were alleged to have been perpetrated by Correctional Services officials employed there by the Minister. They were alleged to have used batons, hands and feet to beat, slap and kick the plaintiffs. Different injuries and sequelae were pleaded for each plaintiff and each of them claimed R500 000 by way of general damages. The plaintiffs annexed 138 separate sets of particulars of claim to the combined summons. That prompted the Minister to enter a special plea which, inter alia, raised a defence that a combined summons was defined in rule 1 as a summons with a statement of claim annexed thereto. If one had regard to Form 10 of the First Schedule to the rules, a summons had to have annexed to it ‘a set of Particulars of Claim’. Because 138 sets of particulars of claim were attached to the summons, the summons was irregular as not complying with Form 10. The High Court upheld the special plea and dismissed the claims. In upholding the plaintiffs’ appeal against the order of the High Court, the Supreme Court of Appeal stated (per Gorven JA):",

After all, if a single, composite set of particulars had been annexed, the present action would simply include paragraphs describing each plaintiff in turn. The other 13 paragraphs which are . . . virtually identical, could then follow one after the other. It may be that the manner in which the particulars of claim have been annexed is unwieldy, but it is not irregular. Of course, this should not be understood as encouraging the practice. It must be said that, in argument before us, the Minister, while not abandoning this point, indicated that it was not being pressed. In my view this was prudent.",

See s 2A(5) of the Prescribed Rate of Interest Act 55 of 1975, as amended, and Adel Builders (Pty) Ltd v Thompson 1999 (1) SA 680 (SE), confirmed on appeal in 2000 (4) SA 1027 (SCA); The MV Sea Joy, Owners of the Cargo Lately Laden on Board the MV Sea Joy v The MV Sea Joy 1998 (1) SA 487 (C) at 508E–I. 60 Section 3(1) of the Prescribed Rate of Interest Act 55 of 1975. The rate of interest prescribed in the first ever notice was 11% (GN R1217 of 16 July 1976). The rate of interest prescribed in the first notice published under s 1 of the Act in its amended form (s 1 was substituted with effect from 8 January 2016 by s 3 of the Judicial Matters Amendment Act 24 of 2015), was 10,25% (GN 226 of 4 March 2016). 61 The term ‘mora’ simply means delay or default (Crookes Brothers Ltd v Regional Land Claims Commission, Mpumalanga 2013 (2) SA 259 (SCA) at 269E–F). 62 Linton v Corser 1952 (3) SA 685 (A) at 695G–696A; Davehill (Pty) Ltd v Community Development Board 1988 (1) SA 290 (A) at 298G–I; Crookes Brothers Ltd v Regional Land Claims Commission, Mpumalanga 2013 (2) SA 259 (SCA) at 268A–269E; Nedbank Ltd v Houtbosplaas (Pty) Ltd 2022 (6) SA 140 (SCA) at paragraphs [50]–[57]. 63 Kessel v Davis 1905 TS 731; Becker v Stusser 1910 CPD 289; West Rand Estates Ltd v New Zealand Insurance Co Ltd 1926 AD 173 at 195–6; Venter v Venter 1949 (1) SA 768 (A) at 784; Van der Merwe v Reynolds 1972 (3) SA 740 (A) at 747A–D; Mokala Beleggings v Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform 2012 (4) SA 22 (SCA) at 25D–C; Crookes Brothers Ltd v Regional Land Claims Commission, Mpumalanga 2013 (2) SA 259 (SCA) at 269E–F. If a settlement agreement which is made an order of court defers payment of a debt to a future date, mora interest shall run from that date, and not from the date of judgment (Dunn v Road Accident Fund 2019 (1) SA 237 (KZD) at 242G–H, 243G–244G, 246A, 246C–E and 246F; and see Motaung v Road Accident Fund and Two Related Matters 2023 (4) 643 (GP)). 64 Bellairs v Hodnett 1978 (1) SA 1109 (A) at 1145D–G; Scoin Trading (Pty) Ltd v Bernstein NO 2011 (2) SA 118 (SCA) at 121C–G; Mokala Beleggings v Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform 2012 (4) SA 22 (SCA) at 25E; Crookes Brothers Ltd v Regional Land Claims Commission, Mpumalanga 2013 (2) SA 259 (SCA) at 269C–D; Nedbank Ltd v Houtbosplaas (Pty) Ltd 2022 (6) SA 140 (SCA) at paragraphs [50]–[57]. 65 Scoin Trading (Pty) Ltd v Bernstein NO 2011 (2) SA 118 (SCA) at 121B–C. 66 Scoin Trading (Pty) Ltd v Bernstein NO 2011 (2) SA 118 (SCA) at 122H. 67 Scoin Trading (Pty) Ltd v Bernstein NO 2011 (2) SA 118 (SCA) at 122H–123A. 68 See Crookes Brothers Ltd v Regional Land Claims Commission, Mpumalanga 2013 (2) SA 259 (SCA) at 269F–G. 69 Nel v Cloete 1972 (2) SA 150 (A); Alfred McAlpine & Son (Pty) Ltd v Transvaal Provincial Administration 1977 (4) SA 310 (T) at 343H– 349B.

The older cases are considered by De Vos (1970) 87 SALJ 304. The statement that mora interest starts to run ‘from the date of receipt of the letter of demand’ (West Rand Estates Ltd v New Zealand Insurance Co Ltd 1926 AD 173 at 183 and 197) is incorrect and decisions in which this view is propounded can no longer be accepted (such as, for example, Ridley v Marais 1939 AD 5; Johnston v Harrison 1946 NPD 239; Pillay Bros (Pty) Ltd v FM Cash Store 1976 (2) SA 660 (E)).",

The court a quo’s conclusion about the so-called “lenient” test namely, that the enquiry is merely “. . . whether in the particular case public policy requires the debtor to be protected against exploitation by the creditor”, which invariably necessitates an enquiry into the identity of the debtor instead of the nature of the debt, is thus based on an incorrect premise.",

    "text": "(Pty) Limited 2019 (4) SA 406 (CC) the central issue in an application for leave to appeal that had to be considered by the Constitutional Court was the question whether the Sectional Titles Act 95 of 1986 deprived individual owners in a sectional title scheme of legal standing to enforce a zoning scheme applicable to the area where the sectional titles scheme was located, where the breach of the zoning scheme regulation occurred on the common property. In other words, the singular issue that arose for determination was whether s 41 (now repealed) of the Act denied the owners standing to seek the mandatory interdict and restricted them to a claim for the appointment of a curator ad litem. The resolution of the issue depended on the wording of s 41 of the Act, read together with ss 36(6) and 37(1). The Supreme Court of Appeal (in Mobile Telephone Networks (Pty) Ltd v Spilhaus Property Holdings (Pty) Ltd 2018 (3) SA 396 (SCA)), in overruling the decision of the High Court, held that the individual owners had no standing. The Constitutional Court, in granting leave to appeal and deciding the appeal, overruled the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal and held (at paragraphs [24]–[43]) that owners of units in a sectional title scheme to which the relevant zoning scheme applied, were entitled to institute proceedings to enforce the zoning scheme and that s 41 of the Act did not preclude them from doing so. Therefore, the Supreme Court of Appeal erred in construing s 41 and concluding that it deprived the owners of legal standing to institute the proceedings. The owners had standing (at paragraph [43]).",

    "text": "580 Van der Westhuizen v Van Sandwyk 1996 (2) SA 490 (W) at 494G–495D. In the Van der Westhuizen case Streicher J held (at 494J– 495A) that the obiter dictum in Mariola v Kaye-Eddie NO 1995 (2) SA 728 (W) at 431E, that all trustees had to be joined unless one of the trustees was authorized by the remaining ones, was no authority for the contention that all the trustees did not have to be joined in order to enforce a right appertaining to the trust. In Desai-Chilwan NO v Ross 2003 (2) SA 644 (C) at 647F–652I the court differed from the judgment of Streicher J and held that all the trustees must be joined unless one of the trustees is authorized by the remaining trustee or trustees. The obiter dictum in Mariola’s case has been followed, without reasoning, in Deutschmann NO v Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service; Shelton v Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service 2000 (2) SA 106 (E) at 119F–G. In Cupido v Kings Lodge Hotel 1999 (4) SA 257 (E) at 263F–G reliance was placed on Goolam Ally Family Trust t/a Textile, Curtaining and Trimming v Textile, Curtaining and Trimming (Pty) Ltd 1989 (4) SA 985 (C) at 988D–E for the proposition that all the trustees need not be joined if one of the trustees is authorized by the other or others. However, in Van der Westhuizen v Van Sandwyk 1996 (2) SA 490 (W) it was held (at 495A–C) that Goolam’s case is not authority for the said proposition. In Land and Agricultural Bank of South Africa v Parker 2005 (2) SA 77 (SCA) one of three trustees ceased to be a trustee yet continued to act as if he was a trustee and signed the trust’s application (i e petition) for leave to appeal. The appeal was also instituted in the names of the three trustees after leave to appeal had been granted. It was held (at 92A) that the trust did not validly apply for leave to appeal nor was it at any stage properly before the full court in the appeal. The full court should have struck the appeal from the roll. In Hyde Construction CC v Deuchar Family Trust 2015 (5) SA 388 (WCC) it was held (at 396C–G) by the full court that the unauthorized institution of proceedings on behalf of a trust could be ratified by a later decision of all the trustees.

In terms of s 30(1) of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 no association consisting of more than 20 persons shall be formed in the Republic for the purpose of carrying on any business that has for its object the acquisition of gain by the association or the individual members thereof, unless it is registered as a company under that Act or is formed in pursuance of some other law or was before 31 May 1962 formed in pursuance of Letters Patent or Royal Charter. The word ‘its’ in the expression ‘that has for its object the acquisition of gain by the association’ in s 8(3) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008 (and formerly in ss 30(1) and 31 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973) is not sufficiently weighty (a) to be indicative of a single dominant purpose with the implication that any other purpose is relegated to the status of a subordinate purpose which must then be discarded and (b) to exclude the feasibility of a duality or even a multiplicity of purposes, provided that they are congruent and not contradictory (Mitchell’s Plain Town Centre Merchants Association v McLeod 1996 (4) SA 159 (A) at 168J–169B; Huey Extreme Club v McDonald t/a Sport Helicopters 2005 (1) SA 485 (C) at 492 A–D). The word ‘gain’ in that expression means a commercial or material benefit or advantage, not necessarily a pecuniary profit, in contradistinction to the kind of benefit or result which a charitable, benevolent, humanitarian, philanthropic, literary, scientific, political, cultural, religious, social, recreational or sporting organization, for instance, seeks to achieve. It is submitted that s 8(3) of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, like ss 30(1) and 31 of the Companies Act 61 of 1973 is concerned with commercial enterprises and ‘gain’ must be given a corresponding meaning (see Mitchell’s Plain Town Centre Merchants Association v McLeod 1996 (4) SA 159 (A) at 169J–170C; and see South African Flour Millers’ Mutual Association v Rutowitz Flour Mills Ltd 1938 CPD 199 at 202–3; Huey Extreme Club v McDonald t/a Sport Helicopters 2005 (1) SA 485 (C) at 492D–H).",
