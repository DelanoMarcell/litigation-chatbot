It is a remedy of a summary and extraordinary nature, allowed in cases where a person 1 requires protection against an unlawful interference, or threatened interference, with his rights. It is essentially a practical remedy and if it appears that, in the form which it is cast, it will not afford the applicant the protection he seeks, the court 2 will hesitate to come to his assistance. An interdict is not a remedy for past invasion of rights, but is concerned with present 3 or future infringements.",

    "text": "Prior to 1975 the two systems had developed, from divergent sources, a very similar approach to the grant of interlocutory injunctions. In both systems the applicant had to satisfy a ‘threshold test’ before he would be granted relief, viz proof of at 11 least a prima facie right on his part. In American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Co the House of Lords, deprecating ‘strength of case’ as a threshold test, laid down a new rule of practice whereby an applicant need no longer demonstrate a strong prima facie case; it is sufficient if the applicant satisfies the court that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious; in other words that there is ‘a serious question to be tried’. Once this hurdle is past, the ‘balance of convenience’ as between the parties becomes the core test. The most important effect of the new approach is that in the interlocutory stage of the proceedings, on evidence presented to it on affidavit, and often (usually) under the pressure of urgency, the court is not obliged to assess the strength of the applicant’s case. The new approach caused considerable stir. It was subjected to trenchant criticism by Lord 12 It also gave rise to a vast, world wide body of academic literature in which the basis Denning MR in Fellowes & Son v Fisher. 13 of injuctive relief is considered anew. In the end it was adopted by the highest courts in most countries where the English procedural model is used, in particular in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The new rule of practice laid down by the House 14 The practice of of Lords has been held not to be ‘in accordance with our law in South Africa and should not be followed’. 15 our courts has nevertheless been rather ambivalent. The impact of the new approach on South African practice in recent years is considered in the notes to paragraph 8 s v ‘Requisites for an interlocutory interdict’ below.",

The applicant invokes the aid of the court to order the respondent to desist from such conduct and, if the respondent does not comply, to enforce its order by way of the sanctions for contempt of court. Secondly, the existence of another remedy will only preclude the grant of an interdict where the proposed alternative will afford the injured party a remedy that gives it similar protection to an interdict against the injury that is occurring or is apprehended. That is why in many cases a court will weigh up whether an award of damages will be adequate to compensate the injured party for any harm they may suffer. There may also be instances where, in the case of a statutory breach, a criminal prosecution, in appropriate circumstances, will provide an adequate remedy, but there are likely to be few instances where that will be the case. Thirdly, the alternative remedy must be a legal remedy, that is, a remedy that a court may grant and, if need be, enforce, either by the process of execution or by way of proceedings for contempt of court. The fact that one of the parties, or even the judge, may think that the problem would be better resolved, or can ultimately only be resolved, by extra-curial means, is not a justification for refusing to grant an interdict.",

Therefore, since the application is merely interlocutory and the effect of the granting thereof is only temporary and not finally decisive of either party’s rights, the court will grant an interdict upon a degree of proof less exacting than that required for the grant of a final interdict. It is in attempting to define this degree of 180 proof — an almost impossible task, it has been held —that the courts have used such varied expressions as ‘a clear right’, ‘a prima facie right’, ‘prima facie proof of a clear right’, ‘a prima facie case for an interdict’ and ‘prima facie grounds for an interdict’.",

Itis perhaps of some importance to note that the leading case of Setlogelo v Setlogelo 1914 AD 221 does not stand at the beginning of a line of development. The evolution of a South African law of interdicts founded upon Van der Linden goes back at least to the middle of the previous century (see, for example, Blackburn v Krohn (1855) 2 Searle 209; Nelson & Meurant v Quin & Co (1874) 4 Buch 46 at 56-7). That is why Innes JA in Setlogelo’s case (at 227) could claim that the ‘requisites for the right to claim an interdict are well known’, and refer to ‘the well-known passage in Van der Linden’s Institutes where he enumerates the essentials for such an application’.

    "text": "19 Final interdicts are frequently referred to as ‘perpetual’ or ‘absolute’ interdicts. While no exception can be taken to the use of the word ‘absolute’ it is suggested that ‘perpetual’ is unsatisfactory if only for the reason that a final or absolute interdict need not necessarily be a perpetual one: the case of Zuurbekom Ltd v Union Corporation Ltd 1947 (1) SA 514 (A) is an illustration of a final interdict granted for a limited time. Interlocutory interdicts are sometimes termed ‘interim’ or ‘temporary’. As these words all indicate the nature of the interdict in question, and cannot give rise to contradictions in terms, there can be no objection to their use at will. For present purposes the author has adopted the use of ‘interlocutory’ and ‘final’.",

The reputation of organs of state is not capable of being defamed and therefore they do not have standing to apply for an interdict prohibiting defamatory statements about them (Minister of Police v Silvermoon Investments 145 CC 2020 (6) SA 586 (KZD) at paragraphs [24], [35], [36], [44] and [48]).

Fault is not a requirement for an interdict based on injurious falsehood: it is sufficient if the representation is false (Elida Gibbs (Pty) Ltd v Colgate Palmolive (Pty) Ltd (1) 1988 (2) SA 350 (W) at 353F; Aetiology Today CC t/a Somerset Schools v Van Aswegen 1992 (1) SA 807 (W) at 820I; Nativa (Pty) Ltd v Austell Laboratories (Pty) Ltd 2020 (5) SA 452 (SCA) at paragraph [53]). The delicts contemplated further include delictual liability for unlawful interference with trade or business (Dun and Bradstreet (Pty) Ltd v SA Merchants Combined Credit Bureau (Cape) (Pty) Ltd 1968 (1) SA 209 (C)). There can be no actionable wrong if there is justification for the conduct which gave rise to such wrong and, accordingly, an interdict will not be granted under such circumstances (Hadjidakis v Hall [2002] 3 All SA 8 (C) at 11b).",

Even then publication will not be unlawful unless a court is satisfied that the disadvantage of curtailing the free flow of information outweighs its advantage. In making that evaluation it is not only the interests of those who are associated with the publication that need to be brought to account but, more important, the interests of every person in having access to information. Applying the ordinary principles that come into play when a final interdict is sought, if a risk of that kind is clearly established, and it cannot be prevented from occurring by other means, a ban on publication that is confined in scope and in content and in duration to what is necessary to avoid the risk might be considered.’",

An interdict restraining a bank from paying in terms of an irrevocable letter of credit will not be granted at the instance of the bank’s customer save in the most exceptional cases (Loomcraft Fabrics CC v Nedbank Ltd 1996 (1) SA 812 (A) at 816C–H). 78 Tsichlas v Touch Line Media (Pty) Ltd 2004 (2) SA 112 (W). In Economic Freedom Fighters v Manuel 2021 (3) SA 425 (SCA) the Supreme Court of Appeal confirmed the well-known principle that persons may seek interdicts, interim or final, by way of motion proceedings against the publication of defamatory statements (at paragraph [111]). This principle was reaffirmed in NBC Holdings (Pty) Ltd v Akani Retirement Fund Administrators (Pty) Ltd [2021] 4 All SA 652 (SCA) at paragraphs [29]–[30]. However, as pointed out in NBC Holdings at paragraph [29], the entitlement to proceed in that way is constrained by the fact that in motion proceedings, where the issue is whether the defendant has a defence to a claim based on defamation, it cannot be decided on motion if there is a dispute as to the applicant’s right to that relief. See also Van Greunen v Govern (unreported, FB case no 5395/2022 dated 6 April 2023) at paragraph [12]; Du Toit v Becket (unreported, WCC case no 8687/2023 dated 21 February 2024) at paragraphs [34]–[35]. In the Economic Freedom Fighters case, applied in Van Greunen, the well-known principle that an unliquidated claim for damages must be pursued by way of action was confirmed in a detailed analysis (at paragraphs [91]–[127]). In Van Greunen it was reaffirmed (at paragraphs [16] and [32]) that motion proceedings are not suited for the prosecution and adjudication of claims for unliquidated damages (which obviously include claims based on the actio iniuriarum for compensation, i e when an injury to dignity and reputation had been caused, as well as damages in the form of an apology). See also Evrigard (Pty) Ltd v Select PPE (Pty) Ltd (unreported, GJ case no 44317/2021 dated 25 April 2023) at paragraphs 39–41; Ndlozi v Media 24 t/a Daily Sun 2024 (1) SA 215 (GJ) at paragraphs 18– 38 (a case where Media 24 was directed to remove the unlawful and defamatory statements concerning the applicant from all its media platforms including its website, Twitter account, and Facebook account within one week of the date of the order, and the applicant’s prayer for an apology and damages were ordered to be dealt with by way of the hearing of oral evidence); IRD Global Ltd v The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (unreported, SCA case no 504/2023 dated 4 July 2024) at paragraphs [24]–[26]. If an interlocutory interdict to restrain publication of defamatory material is sought, the ordinary requirements of an interlocutory interdict apply (Hix Networking Technologies v System Publishers (Pty) Ltd 1997 (1) SA 391 (A) at 398I–399F; Lieberthal v Primedia Broadcasting (Pty) Ltd 2003 (5) SA 39 (W) at 43C–44B). In Hix Networking Technologies v System Publishers (Pty) Ltd 1997 (1) SA 391 (A) at 399B–E and Tau v Mashaba 2020 (5) SA 135 (SCA) at paragraph [22] the following dictum by Greenberg J in Heilbron v Blignaut 1931 WLD 167 at 169 was approved: ‘It does not appear to me that the law as laid down there is in any way peculiar to libel or slander. I think it is the law which would apply to any apprehended injury. If an injury which would give rise to a claim in law is apprehended, then I think it is clear law that the person against whom the injury is about to be committed is not compelled to wait for the damage and sue afterwards for compensation, but can move the Court to prevent any damage being done to him. As he approaches the Court on motion, his facts must be clear, and if there is a dispute as to whether what is about to be done is actionable, it cannot be decided on motion. The result is that if the injury which is sought to be restrained is said to be a defamation, then he is not entitled to the intervention of the Court by way of interdict, unless it is clear that the defendant has no defence. Thus if the defendant sets up that he can prove truth and public benefit, the Court is not entitled to disregard his statement on oath to that effect, because, if his statement were true, it would be a defence, and the basis of the claim for an interdict is that an actionable wrong, i e conduct for which there is no defence in law, is about to be committed.’ In Le Grellier v Kamionsky (unreported, GJ case no 2023-058876 dated 13 November 2023) it was held (at paragraph 41) that, given the general reluctance to grant prior restraints on free expression, courts should almost never grant such restraints ex parte. In cases where such restraints are sought, the very least that would have to be shown to establish a prima facie right to interim relief, in addition to the satisfaction of the ordinary requirements for ex parte relief (including the likelihood of irreparable harm if notice is given, and disclosure of every fact that might be material to the relief sought) is that the person sought to be placed under restraint cannot realistically make out any of the known defences to a claim of defamation on the material facts. In Tau v Mashaba 2020 (5) SA 135 (SCA) it was held (at paragraph [23]) that the mere say-so of a deponent who alleges a defence of justification in an answering affidavit should not be accepted at face value: the facts on which it is based must be analysed to determine its weight. In other words, a factual foundation for a defence of fair comment or truth and public benefit must be established in evidence. See also Buthelezi v Poorter 1974 (4) SA 831 (W) at 836A–F; Hix Networking Technologies v System Publishers (Pty) Ltd 1997 (1) SA 391 (A) at 399F–G. In ENX Group Limited v Spilkin (unreported, ECGq case no 2296/2022 dated 8 November 2022) the applicant sought a final interdict preventing the respondent from, inter alia, defaming the applicant and its CEO, but failed to make out a case for the relief sought. The respondent effectively raised a justification defence of truth and public interest. The application was accordingly dismissed. In Herbal Zone (Pty) Ltd v Infitech Technologies (Pty) Ltd [2017] 2 All SA 347 (SCA) the Supreme Court of Appeal reaffirmed the principle that an interdict to prevent a party from making defamatory statements in the future is ‘only infrequently granted’ as ‘it impinges upon that party’s constitutionally protected right to freedom of speech’. The court recognized that in our constitutional era freedom of speech carries greater weight than it had in the past (at paragraph [36]). See also Du Toit v Becket (unreported, WCC case no 8687/2023 dated 21 February 2024) at paragraph [40]. In Van Greunen v Govern (unreported, FB case no 5395/2022 dated 6 April 2023), the court, although recognizing the Herbal Zone judgment, adopted the following approach: ‘[18] Section 16 of the Constitution guarantees the right of freedom of expression and speech. Human dignity is also guaranteed as specifically provided in s 10 of the Constitution. Although the court stated in Herbal Zone that freedom of speech carries greater weight than in the past, this cannot be interpreted to mean that the right to dignity and reputation of another person should not be considered at all. In casu, the applicants are entitled to the protection of their dignity and reputation. In O-Keeffe v Argus Printing and Publishing Company Co Ltd & Another [1954 (3) SA 244 (CPD) at 247.] Watermeyer AJ quoted De Villiers, the author of Injuries, with approval. Dignity is defined as a “valued and serene condition” in a person’s social or individual life which may be violated, either publicly or privately, by another through “offensive and degrading treatment”, or when the person “is exposed to ill-will, ridicule, disesteem or contempt”. Currie and De Waal [The Bill of Rights Handbook 5th e p 272.] are probably correct by referring to human dignity as “perhaps the pre-eminent value.” This submission is in line with the Constitutional Court’s approach in Christian Education in South Africa v Minister of Education [2000 (4) SA 757 (CC) para 15.] [19] In the event of conflict between two competing constitutional rights, a balancing act is to be exercised. No right is absolute and although the right to human dignity is seen as a central value and even a pre-eminent value, the facts and circumstances in each case need to be considered to established [sic] whether the right to dignity should not be limited. I accept that people serving the public such as lawyers and insolvency practitioners, as in casu, must accept that they may be fiercely criticised from time to time by others such as creditors, disgruntled debtors and even the courts. They are not immune to criticism. In the preparation of this judgment I take cognisance hereof.’ Harms Main Binder in paragraph A5.15 points out that it must be borne in mind in considering the balance of convenience or the exercise of the court’s discretion, that cases involving an attempt to restrain publication must be approached with caution. In particular the right to freedom of speech should not be interfered with lightly and it should be kept in mind that there is a right to damages and that the interim order may be final in effect. See also Midi Television (Pty) Ltd t/a E-TV v Director of Publications (Western Cape) 2007 (5) SA 540 (SCA) at 548F–G (dealing with a restraint on anticipated publication); Economic Freedom Fighters v Manuel 2021 (3) SA 425 (SCA) at paragraphs [87]–[90] (dealing with repetition of publication that has already taken place). The courts do not interdict future defamation in broad terms (Halewood International South Africa v Van Zyl (unreported, GJ case no 2023/019330 dated 31 March 2023) at paragraph [39] and the cases there referred to; Du Toit v Becket (unreported, WCC case no 8687/2023 dated 21 February 2024) at paragraphs [122]–[126]). Rather, a court may interdict specific acts of defamation, for example, it may interdict the respondent from repeating an allegation that the applicant stole money from his employer (Kaymak v Ralushai; Suma Coal (Pty) Ltd v Ralushai (unreported, GJ case no 2016/21096 dated 26 January 2023) at paragraph [12] and the cases there referred to; Nisamoseki Trading Enterprise (Pty) Ltd t/a Nisa Willckx Interiors v Sithole (unreported, GJ case no 2023-101760 dated 26 October 2023) at paragraph [15]; but see Itumele Bus Lines (Pty) Ltd t/a Interstate Bus Lines v Msabe (unreported, FB case no 6450/2022 dated 12 October 2023) at paragraph [57] and paragraph 2 of the order).",

It was held (at 73F–I, 75C–76D and 80E–H) that, in order to obtain an interdict preventing a legal practitioner representing a client against a former client from using or disclosing information received from the former client, the former client would need to prove that (1) confidential information was imparted or received in confidence as a result of the attorney-client relationship and the information remains confidential; (2) it is relevant to the matter at hand; and (3) the interests of the present client are adverse to those of the former client. Where the former client fails to establish any of these requirements, the application for an interdict must fail. In dismissing a subsequent appeal, the Supreme Court of Appeal in Wishart v Blieden NO 2020 (3) SA 99 (SCA) held that the common law did not recognize a right of an individual to restrain a lawyer from acting against him where the individual had never been a",

The application by the appellants to restrain three of the respondents (lawyers) from examining them in an insolvency inquiry was not supported by the facts and the case was not one in which to develop the common law (at paragraphs [49]–[50]).

In upholding the appeal, the Supreme Court of Appeal replaced the High Court’s order with the following order against the sheriff: ‘(a) Unless authorised by a magistrate in terms of section 14(7) of the Magistrates’ Court Act 32 of 1944, the first respondent is directed to effect service and to execute any court process emanating from the office of the applicant without any unreasonable delay; (b) The first respondent is interdicted from requiring payment of any part of his fees or charges in respect of the service or execution of a court process in paragraph (a) above before serving and executing such process; (c) After the service or execution of any court process referred to in paragraph (a) above, the first respondent is directed, without delay and without first requiring prior payment of any part of his fees and charges relating thereto, to return to the applicant and to the court concerned whatever he has done by virtue of such process, specifying his fees and charges on the original and all copies of the returns of service.’ 98 City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality v Glofurn (Pty) Ltd (unreported, SCA case no 136/2023 dated 19 June 2024) at paragraphs [1] and [26]. 99 This kind of interdict is considered exhaustively in Knox D’Arcy Ltd v Jamieson 1994 (3) SA 700 (W) by Stegmann J who deprecates the use of the term ‘Mareva injunction’, derived from English law, to designate the remedy in South African law. Stegmann J suggested that the interdict in question be called an interdict in securitatem debiti or an anti-dissipation interdict. The Appellate Division did not find these names felicitous and pointed out that our law has recognized this type of interdict for many years without giving it any specific name (Knox D’Arcy Ltd v Jamieson 1996 (4) SA 348 (A) at 372A–C).In Meihuizen Freight (Pty) Ltd v Transportes Maritimos de Portugal LDA 2005 (1) SA 36 (SCA) at 45D it was remarked that the term ‘anti-dissipation interdict’ is not entirely accurate. The term has, however, stuck, and it is known for its common usage (Bassani Mining (Pty) Ltd v Sebosat (Pty) Ltd (unreported, SCA case no 835/2020 dated 29 September 2021) at paragraph [1].) 100 In Knox D’Arcy Ltd v Jamieson 1996 (4) SA 348 (A) it was held that this type of interdict is sui generis. The question of an alternative remedy does not arise—the interdict is either available or it is not (at 373C–D). An applicant must, except possibly in exceptional cases, show a particular state of mind on the part of the respondent, i e that he is getting rid of his funds (or that he is wasting or secreting assets), or is likely to do so, with the intention of defeating the claims of his creditors (at 372F–H). In the Knox D’Arcy case the Appellate Division left open the question as to whether, in principle and on authority, such an interdict should be granted in cases where the respondent is in good faith disposing of his own assets, or threatening to do so, and has no intent to render the applicant’s claim nugatory (at 373D–E). The court did, however, remark that there would not normally be any justification to compel a respondent to regulate his bona fide expenditure so as to retain funds in his patrimony for the payment of claims against him (at 372H–I). In Bassani Mining (Pty) Ltd v Sebosat (Pty) Ltd (unreported, SCA case no 835/2020 dated 29 September 2021) the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against the refusal of an anti-dissipation interdict on the basis that the jurisdictional facts for the grant of the remedy (i e the base requirements as laid down in the Knox D’Arcy case) were conspicuously absent, and remarked that it had great difficulty, in such circumstances, to imagine what exceptional circumstances (for lowering the threshold) would be (at paragraph [19]). The Supreme Court of Appeal held, further, that in Carsten v Kullmann (unreported, GJ case no 49174/2017 dated 4 January 2018), on which the appellant relied for lowering the threshold to one that an interdict might be granted even when there was a bona fide disposition of property, the base requirements for the interdict had also not been met. The Supreme Court of Appeal consequently considered it unnecessary to take the discussion on exceptional circumstances any further. In summary, an anti-dissipation interdict provides a remedy where an applicant has shown on the established basis of an interlocutory interdict (a) a claim against a respondent; and (b) except possibly in exceptional circumstances, that the respondent is (intentionally) secreting or dissipating assets or is likely to do so with the intention of defeating the applicant’s claim (KSL v AL (unreported, SCA case no 356/2023 dated 13 June 2024) at paragraphs [16]–[17], reaffirming the decisions in Knox D’Arcy and Bassani (supra)). The Supreme Court of Appeal has emphasized that the order does not create a preference for the applicant to the property interdicted (Carmel Trading Co Ltd v Commissioner, South African Revenue Service 2008 (2) SA 433 (SCA) at 435D). See also Mcitiki v Maweni 1913 CPD 684 at 687; Bricktec (Pty) Ltd v Pantland 1977 (2) SA 489 (T) at 493E–G; Smith v Daniels 1997 (4) SA 711 (SE) at 714J–715A; Pohlman v Van Schalkwyk 2001 (1) SA 690 (E) at 696E–700E; Fedsure Life Assurance Co Ltd v Worldwide African Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd 2003 (3) SA 268 (W) at 282G–283C; Fey NO v Van der Westhuizen 2005 (2) SA 236 (C) at 249B–250B; Metlika Trading Ltd v Commissioner, South African Revenue Service 2005 (3) SA 1 (SCA) at 15C; Msunduzi Municipality v Natal Joint Municipal Pension/Provident Fund 2007 (1) SA 142 (N) at 157C–G; Carmel Trading Co Ltd v Commissioner South African Revenue Service 2008 (2) SA 433 (SCA) at 435C–D and 437D–E; Investec Employee Benefits Ltd v Electrical Industry KwaZulu-Natal Pension Fund 2010 (1) SA 446 (W) at 421B–D; Krog v Botes 2014 (2) SA 596 (GJ) at 600H–601C; Pepkor Holdings Ltd v AJVH Holdings (Pty) Ltd 2021 (5) SA 115 (SCA) at paragraphs [21]–[26] (a case dealing with the requirements for the preservation of res litigiosa); MWS v NSS 2021 (6) SA 201 (NWM) at paragraphs [22]–[25] (a case dealing with a pension interest in a pending divorce action); Tak v Blue Dart Properties (unreported, GJ case no 01361/2023 dated 20 April 2023) at paragraph [4]; Rota Investments CC v Full Score Trading 131 CC (unreported, WCC case no 16881/2022 dated 26 April 2023) at paragraphs 35 and 40–41. The ‘anti-dissipation interdict’ should not be confused with a vindicatory or quasi-vindicatory interdict (Fedsure Life Assurance Co Ltd v Worldwide African Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd 2003 (3) SA 268 (W) at 283D). In Hansen + Genwest (Pty) Ltd v Corporate Selection Umbrella (unreported, GJ case no 2023-002990 dated 6 February 2023) the third respondent had been employed as the applicant’s assistant financial manager until she was dismissed following a disciplinary enquiry in which she had been charged and found guilty of misconduct. The applicant thereafter instituted an action for damages against the third respondent. Subsequently, it applied for an interlocutory interdict contending that the damages that it claimed were caused to it by reason of ‘theft, dishonesty, fraud or misconduct’ on her part as contemplated in s 37D(1)(b)(ii)(bb) of the Pension Funds Act 24 of 1956 and, should it ultimately be successful in that regard, the first respondent (a pension fund administered by the second respondent) would be entitled in terms of the said provision to deduct the amount of damages found to be payable from the third respondent’s pension benefit and to pay the amount over to it. The court, in granting the interlocutory interdict, held (at paragraph [19]) that the interdict was not of an anti-dissipatory nature interdict but fell into the exceptional category of ‘applications for interim relief pending . . . ‘quasi-vindicatory’ actions . . . when delivery of specific property is claimed under some legal right to obtain possession’. It was held (at paragraph [39]) that in order to obtain such relief, an applicant had to establish: (a) on a prima facie basis (though open to some doubt) that the member would by reason of any theft, dishonesty, fraud or misconduct be ordered in the action to pay a sum of damages to the employer that exceeded the value of the pension fund benefit sought to be withheld; (b) that the balance of convenience favoured the withholding of the member’s pension fund benefits in the meantime; and (c) that the applicant had requested the pension fund to exercise its discretion to withhold the pension benefits but the pension fund had unreasonably refused to grant such a request (with such finding of unreasonableness taking into account any specific requirements laid down",

An application by a spouse married in community of property for an anti-dissipation interdict pendente lite to protect such spouse’s (contingent) right to accrual in the other spouse’s estate will not be granted except in the clearest of cases. The applicant would have to show, in addition to a well-grounded apprehension of irreparable harm, that the respondent has assets within the jurisdiction of the court, has no bona fide defence against the applicant’s alleged contingent right, and intends to defeat the applicant’s claim or render it hollow by dissipating or secreting assets (RS v MS 2014 (2) SA 511 (GJ) at 513J–514C). In Lovell v Lovell (unreported, GP case no 24583/2009 dated 22 September 2022) it was held (at paragraph [41]), with reference to JLT v CHT (unreported, EL case no 819/2020 dated 22 January 2021) at paragraph [8], ‘that the requirements that must be satisfied to obtain an anti-dissipation interdict, which is interim in both form and substance, are the same for any other interim interdict’, but that ‘it is not essential to establish an intention on the part of the respondent to frustrate an anticipated judgment if the conduct of the respondent is likely to have that effect’ (at paragraph [40] — emphasis added by the court — with reference to the JLT case at paragraph [7]). See also MD v ND [2021] 1 All SA 909 (GJ). See further Prest Interdicts 160 et seq; Cane (1997) 114 SALJ at 77.

In the Lockie case the funds that the applicant sought to be interdicted had been mixed with the respondent’s funds without authority. Where authority has been given, an interdict will not be granted (Stern & Ruskin NO v Appleson 1951 (3) SA 800 (W) at 811B–F; Fedsure Life Assurance Co Ltd v Worldwide African Investment Holdings (Pty) Ltd 2003 (3) SA 268 (W) at 280G).

The City sought further relief: that, should the respondent not comply, the sheriff be authorized to take all necessary steps to give effect to the interdict, including taking into possession ‘all that [was] found at the property’ and to keep such items that the company was using to conduct an accommodation establishment, pending payment of the City’s ‘reasonable fees and disbursements’ incurred in the execution of the order. The High Court held (at paragraphs [10] and [14]–[17]) that the effect of the order whereby the City sought to enforce the Scheme was the eviction of the occupiers of the property. Consequently, where the City meant to enforce the Scheme through the eviction of people living on the relevant property, further requirements were triggered (at paragraph [20]). The principal requirement was compliance with s 26(3) of the Constitution, which provided that ‘(n)o one may be evicted from their home . . . without an order of court made after considering all the relevant circumstances. No legislation may permit arbitrary evictions.’ (At paragraph [21].) In seeking relief to give effect to the Scheme by removing people who resided on property in breach of the Scheme from their homes, the City was required to demonstrate that it had engaged meaningfully with each of the affected individuals, and that it would provide alternative accommodation to those individuals where it was reasonable to do so. It would be reasonable to provide alternative accommodation if an occupier would be left homeless without it (at paragraph [24]). The City could not demonstrate a clear right to an interdict which enforced the Scheme through an eviction unless it had shown that it had meaningfully engaged the occupiers of the property in question, and offered to provide alternative accommodation where it was reasonably needed (at paragraph 25]). The City had not made out such a case in its application. The application accordingly had to be dismissed (at paragraph [26]).",

In Heroldt v Wills 2013 (2) SA 530 (GSJ) the applicant applied for an order against the respondent to desist from posting any information about him on Facebook or on any other social media. It was argued on behalf of the respondent that the applicant had another remedy available to him, in that he could approach Facebook and ask it to remove the respondent’s post. The court was unconvinced by this argument and concluded that there was no assurance that Facebook would comply with a request to remove the post (at 543E–G and 545G–546D). An interdict was, accordingly, as far as the posting of information about the applicant on Facebook is concerned, granted against the respondent. In BG Bojosinyane & Associates v The Sheriff Vryburg (unreported, SCA case no 1072/2022 dated 8 December 2023) the sheriff demanded exorbitant fees from the appellant before he would effect service of any process sued out by the appellant. The Supreme Court of Appeal replaced the High Court’s order with a mandatory interdict against the sheriff directing him to effect service and execute court process emanating from the office of the appellant, and interdicting him from requiring payment of any part of his fees or charges in respect of the service or execution of a court process before serving and executing such process. Referring to this paragraph with approval, the Supreme Court of Appeal stated (footnotes between [ ]): ‘[33] Finally, as regards the third requirement, the appellant established that it has no satisfactory alternative remedy but to apply to court for appropriate relief. Taxation of the fees and charges demanded in advance is not a remedy because such taxation is not available within the legislative framework. Disciplinary proceedings before a committee of the Sheriff’s Board do not present a satisfactory remedy to the appellant who would still be required first to pay whatever is demanded as a deposit up front before the court process is served or executed. The disciplinary process will take time, and even if the eventual finding is one of some form of unprofessional conduct and a sanction, it will be no remedy to the appellant who in the interim required service and execution of a court process without unreasonable delay. Instituting disciplinary proceedings is therefore not an alternative satisfactory remedy ‘with the same result’, [D E van Loggerenberg Jones and Buckle: Civil Practice of the Magistrates’ Courts in South Africa Volume 1 (Revision Service 27, May 2023) at Act–180; Reserve Bank of Rhodesia v Rhodesia Railways 1966 (3) SA 656 (SR)] nor will it provide adequate redress.[Peri-Urban Areas Health Board v Sandhurst Gardens (Pty) Ltd 1965 (1) SA 683 (T)].’",

Thus, in Witbank Colliery Ltd v Malan and Coronation Colliery Co Ltd 1910 TPD 667 at 679 and 684 the result of a long delay was that in the circumstances damages was the only appropriate remedy left. In Kemp, Sacs & Nell Real Estate (Edms) Bpk v Soll 1986 (1) SA 673 (O) the grant of an interdict would, in the circumstances and as a result of long delay, have served no purpose. 235 Botha v White 2004 (3) SA 184 (T) at 193G–H. 236 See, for example, Messina (Tvl) Development Co Ltd v SAR&H 1929 AD 195 at 215; Yusuf v Abboobaker and Pietermaritzburg Local Road Transportation Board 1943 NPD 244 at 247; Ndauti v Kgami 1948 (3) SA 27 (W) at 36–37; Olympic Passenger Service (Pty) Ltd v Ramlagan 1957 (2) SA 382 (D) at 383E–F; Limbada v Dwarka 1957 (3) SA 60 (N) at 62B–F; Chopra v Avalon Cinemas SA (Pty) Ltd 1974 (1) SA 469 (D) at 472H–473A; Hix Networking Technologies v System Publishers (Pty) Ltd 1997 (1) SA 391 (A) at 399A; Camps Bay Residents and Ratepayers Association v Augoustides 2009 (6) SA 190 (WCC) at 196A–B; Hotz v University of Cape Town 2017 (2) SA 485 (SCA) at 497I–J; Vea Road Maintenance and Civils (Pty) Ltd v South African National Roads Agency SOC Limited (unreported, KZD case no D7913/2023 dated 20 November 2023) at paragraph [35]. In Knox D’Arcy Ltd v Jamieson 1996 (4) SA 348 (A) at 361H–I it is stated, probably obiter, that ‘the statement that a Court has a wide discretion seems to mean no more than that the Court is entitled to have regard to a number of disparate and incommensurable features in coming to a decision.’ In Plettenberg Bay Entertainment (Pty) Ltd v Minister van Wet en Orde 1993 (2) SA 396 (C) it was held (at 399D–401A) that the court did not have a discretion to grant an interlocutory interdict for the protection of a right (pending an appeal) that the court had already found the applicant was not entitled to. This decision was distinguished, qualified and not followed in Indwe Aviation (Pty) Ltd v Petroleum Oil and Gas Corporation of South Africa (Pty) Ltd (No 2) 2012 (6) SA 110 (WCC). 237 Yusuf v Abboobaker and Pietermaritzburg Local Road Transportation Board 1943 NPD 244 at 247; Limbada v Dwarka 1957 (3) SA 60 (N) at 62B–F; Rizla International BV v L Suzman Distributors (Pty) Ltd 1996 (2) SA 527 (C) at 536C–D.

The equality court found, albeit on a prima facie basis, that Nedbank’s decision to close the respondents’ accounts was based on unfair racial discrimination. This is a serious charge. Racism is a scourge which has infected the fabric of our national life for well over three hundred years. The Equality Act was specifically devised, in part, to address and eliminate this scourge. Any order under this section of the Equality Act requires a finding that the entity against which the order is granted has unfairly discriminated on the ground of race. A finding of that nature has obvious serious reputational repercussions, particularly considering Nedbank’s standing as one of the major banks in South Africa. Where a case is properly made out for an order having this effect, a party cannot be heard to complain. However, where, as in this case, the order ought never to have been made, justice requires that the impugned decision is rendered appealable and rectified.’",
