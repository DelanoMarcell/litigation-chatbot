In Ex parte Goosen the full court held that s 115, properly interpreted, meant that anyone who, as at 1 November 2018, had satisfied the criteria for admission as an advocate existing at such time in terms of the Admission of Advocates Act 74 of 1964 was entitled to admission as a legal practitioner under s 24 of the Legal Practice Act 28 of 2014. The right to invoke s 115 was not restricted to those whose applications were pending as at 1 November 2018, i e it extended to those making application on or at any time after such date. In 5 reaching such conclusion, the full court acknowledged that such an interpretation could mean that untrained advocates could indefinitely be allowed to practise, a situation at odds with the clear objectives of the Legal Practice Act 28 of 2014 to create 6 7 equivalence between the legal training of advocates and attorneys. However, it found that such consideration had to yield, in the case it dealt with, to the presumption of statutory interpretation of the preservation of vested rights, except where the 8 clearest indication to the contrary was expressed in the statute. The full court added that the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services should consider amending the legislation to cure such anomaly.",
