In accordance with Bee, if they agree on issues of fact and the appropriate approach to technical analysis, the litigants are bound by those agreements, unless they have been withdrawn in circumstances where no prejudice results, or any prejudice can be cured by an adjournment or other means. If the experts have reached agreement on a common opinion on a matter within their joint expertise, that is merely part of the total body of evidence. The court must still determine whether to accept the joint opinion. The existence of that agreement between the experts will not ordinarily preclude evidence that qualifies or contradicts their opinion, unless the case has been conducted on the basis of the agreement and the admission of that evidence will prejudice the other party in a manner that cannot be cured. If the parties choose to place an agreed minute before the court reflecting both shared opinions and areas of disagreement and do not call the parties to the minute to deal with the areas of disagreement, the minute will do no more that reflect that there is disagreement on the point. While it is for the parties to determine which witnesses they call, if they fail to call the authors of a joint minute they cannot object when other witnesses express views that qualify or dissent from the views in the minute.",

In regard to the phrase ‘his reasons therefor’, the court held that it means, or at least includes, the facts or data on which the opinion is based. However, the ‘summary’ also governs ‘his reasons therefor’; hence the testimony that the expert witness intends to give need not be fully set out in the summary. The summary must at least state the sum and substance of the facts and data which lead to the reasoned conclusion (i e the 58 opinion). In this regard Wessels JA stated:",

She was criticised in relation to matters that were known to be irrelevant, such as her failure to perform an otoscopy. Her notes and other documents were subjected to forensic scrutiny and criticism of a type one encounters with the most pedantic lawyers. Conclusions contrary to her diagnosis were expressed on the basis that her notes were not as complete as Dr Goosen and Dr Edeling thought desirable. The medical literature was used selectively to bolster arguments and not for the purpose of informing the court of the current approach to the clinical assessment of head injuries in children and the range of accepted medical views.

The court will not allow the provisions of the subrule to be evaded by setting itself up as an expert nor admit the evidence of an expert by allowing him to be styled non-expert (Stewarts Lloyds of SA Ltd v Croydon Engineering & Mining Supplies (Pty) Ltd 1979 (1) SA 1018 (W)). In IM v Road Accident Fund 2023 (1) SA 573 (FB) the Road Accident Fund’s counsel indicated to the court that she had received instructions to admit the plaintiff’s expert reports by mere submission thereof to the court. The subsequent argument presented on behalf of the plaintiff was based on the facts, opinions, postulations and calculations of the experts. The arguments on behalf of the Road Accident Fund, which were tantamount to opinion, were that of the Fund’s counsel and not that of an expert. The latter argument was frustrated by the fact that no expert evidence, or any evidence at all, was submitted on the issues that were raised by her. On her word from the bar, it remained pure and mere speculation. The court would therefore not take cognizance thereof for its mere vagueness, generalness and unsubstantiated nature. The court emphasized that the common theme in the approach of courts adopted towards expert evidence was that courts had to jealously protect their role and powers (at paragraphs [14]–[15]).",

In Bee v Road Accident Fund 2018 (4) SA 366 (SCA) the majority held (at 386A–388A) that effective case management required parties to stick to the facts agreed in a joint minute. If a litigant wished to depart from it, it had to give due warning to the other side, and the same went for the experts themselves. Therefore, if the Fund’s expert had wished to testify inconsistently with the agreement in the joint minute, it should have notified the other side before the start of the trial. The Fund’s conduct amounted to impermissible trial by ambush. The trial court was entitled, if not bound, to accept the matters agreed by the experts, and its decision not to ask them to lead further evidence was therefore entirely justified.",
