In summary, the majority held that under s 165(5) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, (a) a court order is binding until set aside, irrespective of whether it was valid; (b) judicial orders wrongly issued were not nullities but existed in fact and might have legal consequences; and (c) whether an order was enforceable depended on whether the judge had the authority to make the decision at the time that the order was made. Consequently, it 5 was held that a party bound by an invalid order must comply with the order until it is set aside. Thus, if a summons had not 6 been served on a defendant, a subsequent judgment may be set aside in terms of rule 42(1)(a). Mere knowledge of issue of summons does not constitute service and cannot relieve a plaintiff of the obligation to follow the prescribed rules. If service 7 of a summons was not effected according to the letter of the rule but was still effective in that the defendant received the 8 summons, and suffered no prejudice, service will be good.

What happened in this case clearly shows that the office of the sheriff treats judgment debtors differently based on their social, economic or racial classification. This is certainly unacceptable as the law requires people to be treated the same by an officer of the court. A sheriff’s office is not a negotiating forum where the rich and classy are called to hammer out deals and subvert court processes, while the poor are subjected to unkind treatment, where their goods get removed in the dead of night and at times sold below market value for no reason other than that they are poor and oftentimes black.",

    "text": "In Motloung v Sheriff, Pretoria East 13 the appellants were involved in a motor vehicle collision on 15 January 2007. They instructed their attorney to institute action against the Road Accident Fund (‘the RAF’) for damages arising from the collision. A summons was prepared and taken to the registrar of the Gauteng Division of the High Court, Pretoria. The registrar allocated a case number and stamped the summons. The stamp contained the date on which he processed the summons, his designation as registrar and his name. The summons was returned to the attorney for service. It later emerged, however, that the registrar had not signed the summons as required by rule 17(3)(c). The appellants’ attorney sent the summons to the respondent for service. The respondent refused to serve it. He took the view that ‘only once a summons is signed by the registrar [is it] constituted as a court process’. He contended that the summons was a nullity and did not amount to court process and that he was accordingly not obliged or permitted to serve it. Because the summons was not served, the claim against the RAF prescribed. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the summons was not a nullity and that non-compliance with the provision of rule 17(3)(c) as to signature could be condoned under rule 27(3). The following was said about the 14 conduct of the respondent:",

It is not for sheriffs to judge whether a summons is a nullity or susceptible of condonation. That is a matter for courts to decide within the context of a proper ventilation of the issues. As can be seen from this matter, some complexity may attend on that determination. The approach which was taken by the respondent was regrettable and is to be strongly discouraged.’",
