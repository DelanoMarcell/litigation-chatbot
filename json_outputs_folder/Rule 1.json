In Nedcor Bank v The Master the Supreme Court of Appeal declined to follow these earlier decisions and to apply the ‘clear days’ method of calculation. In dealing with s 40(2) of the Insolvency Act 24 of 1936 (which provides that ‘[t]he Master shall publish such notice on a date not less than ten days before the date upon which 35 the meeting is held’) the court held that the first and last days are to be established solely by reference to the language of the provision under consideration and with due regard to the circumstances of each particular case. In applying s 4 of the 36 Interpretation Act 33 of 1957 to s 40(2) of the Insolvency Act, the court held that reckoning backwards was the appropriate method, that the named (first) day (i e the day on which the meeting was to be held) was to be excluded and that the last day (i e the day on which the Master published the notice) was to be included. In view of the aforesaid it is submitted that, where a rule requires an act to be performed a particular number of days ‘before’ a named day and it does not explicitly appear from the wording of such rule that the ‘clear days’ method of computation is applicable (e g from wording such as ‘both the first and last days to be exclusive’), the correct method to apply is the statutory method enacted by s 4 of the Interpretation Act 33 of 1957. Normally, but not exclusively, reckoning in such instances would be backwards.",

In this case it was held, further, that (footnotes indicated between [ ]): ‘26. As a general rule, in the absence of any contrary indication, a period of time must be computed according to the ordinary civil method in terms of which “fractions of a day are not admitted” and “no account is taken of broken units”, “a whole day [is] one point of time”. [Joubert v Enslin 1910 AD 6, at p. 26 and 34; Tiopaizi Appellant v Bulawayo Municipality Respondent 1923 AD 317, p. 321 and 326; Kleynhans v Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd 1957 (3) SA 544 (A), at 449 F; and Dormell Properties 282 CC v Renasa Insurance Co Ltd and Others NNO 2011 (1) SA 70 (SCA), para. 27. (In Coface South Africa Insurance Co Ltd v East London Own Haven t/a Own Haven Housing Association 2014 (2) SA 382 (SCA), the SCA held that Dormell was wrongly decided by the majority on a different issue.)] As pointed out by Cloete J, as he then was, in the minority judgment in Dormell Properties 282 CC v Renasa Insurance Co Ltd and Others NNO, the old authorities generally permitted “the whole of the day” and the last day of any stipulated period “must have ended” before the period expired. The day ended on the “close of the day”, not on the close of business. Our courts adopted [Joubert v Enslin supra] and continue to apply [Justice Alliance of South Africa v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others 2011 (5) SA 388 (CC), para.6; and Arendsnes Sweefspoor CC v Botha 2013 (5) SA 399 (SCA), at para. 1 and 20.] this aspect of the civil method, and in the pursuit of certainty do not readily depart from the civil method of computing time. [Kleynhans v Yorkshire Insurance Co Ltd 1957 (3) SA 544 (A), at 549 F and 550 G; South African Mutual Fire and General Insurance Co Ltd v Fouché en ’n Ander; AA Mutual D Insurance Association Ltd v Tlabakoe 1970 (1) SA 302 (A) at 316B–C; and Nedcor Bank Ltd v the Master and Others 2002 (1) SA 390 (SCA), para. 12] Accordingly, a day ordinarily begins and ends in the immeasurable moment on either side of midnight. 27. This aspect of the civil method of calculating time is applied to the periods stipulated in inter alia the uniform rules of court [Felix and Another v Nortier NO and Others (2) 1994 (4) SA 502 (SE), at 504G.] and in instances where the whole of the day was not intended, the uniform rules of court specified the fraction of the day which did apply by stipulating the time of day by or during which the contemplated action must be performed. For example, rule 32 (prior to amendment in 2019) required a defendant to file the affidavit opposing summary judgment prior to noon on the court day preceding the day on which the application is to be heard; a similar requirement is found in rule 6(4) (a); noon is also set as the cutoff in rules 6(5)(c) and 8(4) and (5); and the inspection of documents provided for in rules 35(6) and 70(3B) (a)(i) may only take place during business hours. The uniform rules of court do not expressly do so in rule 28(2) and the absence of any restriction in rule 28(2) is an indication that none was intended.’ 29 ‘Month’ means a calendar month (s 2 of the Interpretation Act 33 of 1957). If a period of time is expressed in terms of weeks or months, the common law applies (Joubert v Enslin 1910 AD 6 at 36–7; Lammas v Nicholls and Alderson 1911 TPD 968 at 977–8; Du Plessis v United African Furnishing Co 1921 OPD 156 at 159–60; Nair v Naicker 1942 NPD 3 at 6; Somdaka v Northern Insurance Co Ltd 1961 (4) SA 764 (D) at 769; Nedcor Bank Ltd v The Master 2002 (1) SA 390 (SCA) at 395D–E.
