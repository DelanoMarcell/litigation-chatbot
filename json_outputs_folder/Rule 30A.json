    "text": "General. Rule 30(5) used to provide a remedy where a party failed to comply timeously with a request made or notice given pursuant to the rules. The subrule was deleted by GN R2407 of 13 December 1996. The reason for the deletion was probably because the rest of rule 30 deals with the situation where an irregular step has been taken by a party to proceedings. Prior to its repeal, the subrule was the source of some controversy. There was difference of opinion as to whether it was intended to apply in all cases where a particular rule did not itself provide for a special sanction for non-compliance with a notice or request, as for example in rules 14(5), 14(9), 36(2) and 37(1), but not in cases where such a special sanction was provided 1 for, as for example in rules 21(6) (prior to the substitution of rule 21 in 1987) and 35(7). This rule now provides a general remedy for non-compliance with the rules. It follows the wording of the repealed subrule (5) of rule 30, except that it is applicable to any failure to comply with these rules, or with a request made or notice given pursuant to the rules, or with an order or direction made by a court or in a judicial case management process referred to in rule 37A.",
