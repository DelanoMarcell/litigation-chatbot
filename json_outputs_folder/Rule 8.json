Provisional sentence (namptissement or handvulling) is an extraordinary, summary and interlocutory 2 remedy designed to enable a creditor who has liquid proof of his claim to obtain a speedy judgment therefor without resorting 3 to the more expensive and dilatory machinery of an illiquid action. Provisional sentence precludes a defendant with no valid 4 defence from ‘playing for time’. Apart from the fact that provisional sentence is only available to a plaintiff who is armed with a liquid document, two further inherent characteristics of provisional sentence have always rendered it distinguishable from other remedies. The one is that it only leads to a provisional or interlocutory order. Final judgment is still to be considered in the principal case. In the final instance, the claim against the defendant can still be dismissed. The other is that, while on the one hand it entitles the plaintiff to payment of the judgment immediately, that is, before entering into the principal case, on 5 the other hand it affords the defendant to insist on security for repayment pending the final outcome.",

Absent either one of these lines, the provisional sentence procedure will not limit the defendant’s right to present his or her case, and thus the right to a fair hearing, in any way.

In Chamani v 133 it is pointed out that it is customary to conclude a contract using a firm’s name, or to St Ives Trading Co (Pty) Ltd acknowledge liability in favour of a firm in a liquid document. The nominal beneficiary referred to in the instrument is not a legal 134 persona: the rights vest in the proprietor, or in the case of a partnership in the partners. Similar considerations apply when provisional sentence is claimed against a defendant on a liquid document signed by it in a trade name differing markedly from the defendant’s real name.

In Fraser & Chalmers South Africa (Pty) Ltd v Tuckers Land Development Corporation (Pty) Ltd 1977 (2) SA 465 (W), followed in Moraitis v De Canha 1984 (1) SA 420 (W), it was held (at 468A–E) that no reference could be made to the main contract between the parties for the purpose of determining whether an engineer’s certificate was a liquid document or not although such contract formed part of the papers. In Randcon (Natal) (Pty) Ltd v Florida Twin Estates (Pty) Ltd 1973 (4) SA 181 (D) it was held (at 185C–H) that the court could look at a contract, that formed part of the papers, to ascertain in what capacity an architect’s certificate was signed under circumstances where the certificate contained an allegation that the amount certified to be due and payable was due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff. Such an allegation was not contained in the certificate under consideration in the Fraser & Chalmers case (supra) thus distinguishing it from the Radcon case (supra).",

Broadly speaking, the requirements for the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment are that the foreign court had ‘international competency’ according to South African law; that the judgment is final and conclusive in its effect and has not become superannuated; that its recognition and enforcement would not be contrary to public policy; that it was not obtained by fraudulent means; does not involve the enforcement of a penal or revenue law of the foreign state; and is not precluded by the provisions of the Protection of Businesses Act 99 of 1978 (Lindsey v Conteh 2024 (3) SA 68 (SCA) at paragraph [18], referring to Jones v Krok 1995 (1) SA 677 (A) at 685B–D). A foreign judgment can also be impeached on other grounds under the common law. Before its judgment will be recognized, certain minimum standards of justice must have been observed by the foreign court in its proceedings, including that court’s impartiality, reasonable notice to affected persons and an application of the audi alteram partem principle (Wile v MEC, Department of Public Works, Gauteng 2017 (1) SA 125 (WCC) at 133D–G). As to the requirements for the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment, see further, in general, the notes to s 29(1)(g) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 32 of 1944 s v ‘Foreign judgments’ in Jones & Buckle Civil Practice vol I.",

That called for extrinsic evidence on the relevant foreign law in order to determine whether the debt concerned was one in monetary terms. In refusing to grant provisional sentence, the High Court held that it was not for the court to pronounce on a matter of procedures of a foreign court, which were unknown to it, after the fact of the foreign judgment (at paragraph [65], referring to Society of Lloyd’s v Price; Society of Lloyd’s v Lee 2006 (5) SA 393 (SCA)). The High Court found that the foreign judgment did not constitute prima facie proof of a debt enforcement and dismissed the application for provisional sentence. An appeal against the order of the High Court was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Appeal sub nomine Lindsey v Conteh 2024 (3) SA 68 (SCA). The Supreme Court of Appeal did, however, state (footnotes between [ ]):",

In this case the court ordered the plaintiff, when suing out a writ of execution, to provide an affidavit sworn by an authorized dealer in foreign exchange, stating the relevant rate of exchange immediately prior to the suing out of the writ. Such an affidavit serves not only to fix the rate of exchange to be used in calculating the amount in South African rand that the sheriff must realize in terms of the writ, but also to guide the registrar in fixing the amount of security de restituendo in terms of subrule (9). This form of order was followed in Friedrich Kling GmbH v Continental Jewellery Manufacturers 1993 (3) SA 76 (C) at 87I–J and 90A–C.",

Wepener J regarded the document that had been electronically received by the plaintiff as an original document (at 320A–321C) and, with regard to the provisions of s 15 of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 25 of 2002, held that the document should be given due evidential weight (at 321C–322C).
