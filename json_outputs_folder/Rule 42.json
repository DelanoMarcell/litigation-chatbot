The Stander and Eisenberg decisions similarly only dealt with the words ‘absence of any party affected thereby’ in paragraph (a) of subrule (1) and not with the words ‘any party affected’ in subrule (1). Both of these decisions also dealt with applications for rescission brought by affected parties who were absent when the orders against them were erroneously sought and granted.

This gives rise to an incongruent result. If the application is ex parte in nature, the applicant who sought and obtained the order may seek to rescind it. However, the applicant who sought and obtained the order in an application where others were party to it would not enjoy that competence. Rescission in the latter situation would only be available if one of those parties was absent, and then only at the instance of that absent party.

I accept this. I do not, however, accept that litigants can be allowed to butcher, of their own will, judicial process which in all other respects has been carried out with the utmost degree of regularity, only to then, ipso facto (by that same act), plead the “absent victim”.

And he ought to have known that that relief was well within the bounds of what this Court was competent to grant if the crime of contempt of court was established. Mr Zuma, having the requisite notice and knowledge, elected not to participate. Frankly, that he took issue with the Commission and its profile is of no moment to a rescission application. Recourse along other legal routes were available to him in respect of those issues, as he himself acknowledges in his papers in this application. Our jurisprudence is clear: where a litigant, given notice of the case against them and given sufficient opportunities to participate, elects to be absent, this absence does not fall within the scope of the requirement of rule 42(1)(a). And, it certainly cannot have the effect of turning the order granted in absentia, into one erroneously granted.

Their disadvantages, which far outweigh that benefit, lie at opposite ends of the interpretive spectrum. At the one end, they may lead to a fragmentation of the process of interpretation by conveying that it must commence with an initial search for the “ordinary grammatical meaning” or “natural meaning” of the words used in isolation, to be followed in some instances only by resort to the context. At the other, they beguile judges into seeking out intention free from the constraints of the language in question, and then imposing that intention on the language used. Both of these are contrary to the proper approach, which is from the outset to read the words used in the context of the document as a whole and in the light of all relevant circumstances.

Sometimes the language of the provision, when read in its particular context, seems clear and admits of little if any ambiguity. Courts say in such cases that they adhere to the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words used. However, that too is a misnomer. It is a product of a time when language was viewed differently and regarded as likely to have a fixed and definite meaning; a view that the experience of lawyers down the years, as well as the study of linguistics, has shown to be mistaken. Most words can bear several different meanings or shades of meaning and to try to ascertain their meaning in the abstract, divorced from the broad context of their use, is an unhelpful exercise. The expression can mean no more than that, when the provision is read in context, that is the appropriate meaning to give to the language used. At the other extreme, where the context makes it plain that adhering to the meaning suggested by the apparently plain language would lead to glaring absurdity, the court will ascribe a meaning to the language that avoids the absurdity. This is said to involve a departure from the plain meaning of the words used. More accurately it is either a restriction or extension of the language used by the adoption of a narrow or broad meaning of the words, the selection of a less immediately apparent meaning or sometimes the correction of an apparent error in the language in order to avoid the identified absurdity.",

For this reason, it was said in Ntshwaqela 166 that although the order must be read as part of the entire judgment, and not as a separate document, the order’s meaning, if clear and unambiguous, cannot be restricted or extended by anything else stated in the judgment. The modern approach is not to undertake interpretation in discrete stages but as a unitary exercise in which the court seeks to ascertain the meaning of a provision in the light of the document as a whole and in the context of admissible background material. This principle applies to the interpretation of court orders, as decisions of this Court make plain.’",

When counsel for the applicant commenced to address the court a quo on the merits of the main application, counsel for the third respondent interjected and drew the court’s attention to the fact that the third respondent was not granted the opportunity of addressing that court on the merits of the application for a postponement. The approach by the court a quo to that point of order was startling. The court a quo’s retort was merely ‘[t]hen consider what I have said up to now is a prima facie view. If you want to argue it, please do’. The content and context of that passage was the crux of the appeal before the full court (at paragraphs [9]–[12]). The full court held that when the court a quo pronounced upon the application for postponement, it was functus officio; the travesty of justice was merely perpetuated when the court a quo gratuitously granted the third respondent the opportunity to argue its application for a postponement, if it so wished. The order dismissing the application for postponement stood until set aside, rescinded, or recalled (at paragraph [13]). The appeal against the order accordingly succeeded, the order was set aside and the matter was referred back to the court of first instance, differently constituted, to hear it de novo (at paragraph [16]).",

In this case, Mr Zuma submitted that if he failed to establish the requirements for rescission under rule 42 or the common law, the Court nevertheless had to reconsider its order on the basis that the meaning of a rescindable error, as captured by rule 42, had to be expanded to permit for rescission applications in which a litigant impugned the constitutionality, or part thereof, of an order of court. He submitted that this was so because of the inclusion of the words ‘with such modifications as may be necessary’ in rule 29 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court, which incorporated rule 42 into the proceedings of the Court (at paragraph [78]). The Court rejected the submission (at paragraphs [79]–[85]). The Court did, however, consider whether the interests of justice warranted the rescission of its order (at paragraphs [86]–[93]). As far as truly exceptional circumstances were concerned, it came to the following conclusion (per Khampepe J, writing for the majority — footnotes omitted):",

The grounds for rescission of a judgment are particularly, and deliberately, narrow in scope in order to preserve the doctrine of finality and legal certainty. By contrast, an appeal is considerably broader and is premised on the allegation that a court made an error in fact or law in reaching a decision and granting an order (Zuma v Secretary of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector Including Organs of State 2021 (11) BCLR 1263 (CC) at paragraph [9] footnote 7).",

The Minister subsequently obtained an order rescinding the orders.

In Minister of Finance v Sakeliga NPC (previously Afribusiness NPC) 2022 (4) SA 401 (CC) the Minister of Finance sought direct access to the Constitutional Court on an urgent basis for the variation of its order which had dismissed his appeal from the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Minister claimed that the order was ambiguous or lacked clarity and was thus susceptible to variation under rule 42(1)(b). The Supreme Court of Appeal had declared the Minister’s regulations made in terms of the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act 5 of 2000 invalid, and suspended the declaration of invalidity for 12 months to enable corrective action. The order of the Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal without any mention of any suspension of the order. In the minority judgment, in a footnote, it was said that ‘(t)he period of suspension expired on 2 November 2021’. The Minister contended that the fact that the majority did not address that footnote, resulted in a lack of clarity which was exacerbated by the order simply saying that the appeal was dismissed and not setting aside, replacing, substituting or in any way varying the order of the Supreme Court of Appeal. That confusion, according to the Minister, gave rise to different possible interpretations of the order (at paragraphs [2]–[6]). The Constitutional Court held that:",
