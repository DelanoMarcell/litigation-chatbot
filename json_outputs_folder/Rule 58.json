Interpleader is a form of procedure whereby a person in possession of property not his own (e g a stakeholder or other custodian of property to which he lays no claim in his own right), which is claimed from him by two or more other persons, is enabled to call upon the rival claimants to such property to appear before the court in order that the right to such property, as between the rival claimants, may be determined without putting the holder of the property to the trouble and 2 expense of an action or actions. Interpleader in the case of execution is a species of this genus. By delivering the money or other property in dispute to the registrar in the manner provided in the rule, the applicant divests himself of the dispute, the 3 money or property being then held by the registrar for payment or delivery to the successful claimant. The effect of the 4 procedure is that any action by either of the claimants against the applicant is stayed. The applicant is not entitled to settle with a claimant and then claim the return of the amount he has lodged with the registrar. This would be running counter to his 5 own act and to the legal position he has created for the claimants by that act.",
