If there has been a long delay, the court should require the party in default to satisfy the court that the relief sought should be granted, 24 especially in a case where the applicant is the dominus litis. It is not sufficient for the applicant to show that condonation will not result in prejudice to the other party. An applicant for relief under this rule must show good cause; the question of 25 prejudice does not arise if it is unable to do so. The court will refuse to grant the application where there has been a reckless or intentional disregard of the rules of court, or the court is convinced that the applicant does not seriously intend to",
