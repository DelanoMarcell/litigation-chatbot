Or was it sufficient for it, as occurred here, to 2 simply apply orally for leave from the court to amend on the day of hearing? The court held that rule 24(8) postulated two procedures by which a party seeking an amendment may approach a court for leave to amend. One was oral: by this method, all that the applicant had to do after receiving the notice of objection was to set such a matter down for hearing and on the date of hearing simply walk into court and orally apply for leave to amend. The other was to lodge a formal application for leave to amend as enjoined by the provisions of rule 28(4). It was left entirely to the discretion of the applicant to decide with which course to proceed. Accordingly, the matter was properly before the court. Rule 1 was substituted with effect from 22 3 November 2019, and now includes a definition of ‘application’, viz ‘a proceeding commenced by notice of motion or other forms of applications provided for by rule 6’. Rule 6(11) and (14) makes specific provision for interlocutory and other applications incidental to other proceedings. It is submitted that in the light of the aforegoing an application to amend as contemplated in rule 28(4) should comply with the relevant provisions of rule 6 and cannot be made orally from the bar. To this extent the decision in the De Kock case should therefore not be followed.",

A notice of intention to defend was delivered on behalf of ‘the Defendant’, recording the latter’s address as being at ‘1[. . .] E[. . .] Rd, S[. . .], Centurion, Gauteng’. The defendant subsequently delivered an exception [sic] to the summons and particulars of claim, raising, amongst other things, a complaint that the plaintiff had instituted action against a non-entity, alternatively against the incorrect defendant. The exception prompted the plaintiff to give notice of his intention to amend the summons and particulars of claim by changing the description of the defendant to ‘OUTsurance Company Limited [sic], an insurance company . . .’. The intended amendment was met with an objection by the defendant going to both process and effect. From the point of view of process, the defendant complained that the proposed amendment was tantamount to an irregular step. In its opinion the plaintiff sought to circumvent the provisions of rules 10 and 41: rule 10 because he purported to substitute the defendant with another party, which could not be countenanced under the auspices of rule 28 as the correct procedure would have been to join the ‘new’ defendant under rule 10; and rule 41 because the plaintiff ought to have withdrawn the action against the defendant as originally named and described, and instituted a fresh action against the ‘new’ defendant. The plaintiff could therefore not succeed in the intended amendment as the current appellation of the defendant could not be deemed to be a mere misnomer of ‘OUTsurance Insurance Company Ltd’. Hartle J, however, had a different view in allowing the amendment:",

When they sought to withdraw the admission by amending their plea, the plaintiff objected, citing prejudice.

See, however, Cordier v Cordier 1984 (4) SA 524 (C) at 533C; and see Brandon v Minister of Law and Order 1997 (3) SA 68 (C) at 75E–F, a case dealing with a statutory limitation period under s 32 of the (now repealed) Police Act 7 of 1958.

In Nativa Manufacturing (Pty) Ltd v Keymax Investments 125 (Pty) Ltd 2020 (1) SA 235 (GP) the applicant sought to join the third respondent as defendant in an action for damages it had instituted against the first respondent. The third respondent resisted joinder on the ground that the claim against it had prescribed. The key question before court was whether the application for joinder had had the effect of interrupting the running of prescription. The court, after a detailed analysis of the case law (at paragraphs [10]–[40]), found that there was no ground for the distinction drawn in Huyser between that case and Peter Taylor. The same fundamental issue arose in both cases, namely, whether the service of the joinder application interrupted the running of prescription under s 15(1) of the Prescription Act 68 of 1969 and the facts were in all material respects aligned. Since the finding of the court in Huyser that it was not bound by Peter Taylor was wrong, the court was entitled to depart from the decision in Huyser. It was held that the service of the application for joinder did not constitute service of process whereby a creditor claimed payment of a debt as required by s 15(1) of the Act, and consequently it did not interrupt prescription (at paragraphs [41]–[42]). 92 Ishmael v Brendan Lune Medical Practice (unreported, GJ case no A5025/2022 dated 7 June 2023 — a decision of the full court) at paragraphs [18]–[24]. 93 Welken NO v Nasionale Koerante Bpk 1964 (3) SA 87 (O). 94 This submission is based on the observations in regard to prescription in Cordier v Cordier 1984 (4) SA 524 (C) at 535G–H.

In the latter case it was held (at 133g– 134e) that there is a fundamental difference in approach between applications of amendments and the determination of whether there is compliance with a statutory provision such as s 15(1) of the Prescription Act 68 of 1969, and that the principles applying to each of the two situations should not be applied willy-nilly to the other. 107 Embling v Two Oceans Aquarium CC 2000 (3) SA 691 (C) at 696H; Four Tower Investments (Pty) Ltd v André’s Motors 2005 (3) SA 39 (N) at 44A–B. 108 Four Tower Investments (Pty) Ltd v André’s Motors 2005 (3) SA 39 (N) at 44C–E. In this case it was held (at 44F–G) that in such an event the wrong description of the plaintiff would have been nothing but a mere misdescription of the correct creditor, and that the amendment would serve to achieve no more than to correct a misdescription of the already existing plaintiff. 109 Four Tower Investments (Pty) Ltd v André’s Motors 2005 (3) SA 39 (N) at 45D–E. 110 Associated Paint & Chemical Industries (Pty) Ltd t/a Albestra Paint and Lacquers v Smit 2000 (2) SA 789 (SCA); Four Tower Investments (Pty) Ltd v André’s Motors 2005 (3) SA 39 (N) at 45E–G; Solenta Aviation (Pty) Ltd v Aviation @ Work (Pty) Ltd 2014 (2) SA 106 (SCA) at 111B–C. 111 Dischem Pharmacies (Pty) Ltd t/a Mondeor Pharmacy v United Pharmaceutical Distributors (Pty) Ltd t/a UPD Lea Glen 2004 (2) SA 166 (W). 112 Dumasi v Commissioner, Venda Police 1990 (1) SA 1068 (V) at 1071D–E.

In East London Industrial Development Zone (Soc) Ltd v Wild Coast Abalone (Pty) Ltd (unreported, ECEL case no EL536/2019 dated 30 November 2023) the plaintiff instituted an action for damages, and other relief, against Wild Coast Abalone (Pty) Ltd and Mr A Bok arising from their alleged unlawful occupation of the plaintiff’s property. Wild Coast denied that it occupied the property and pleaded that Aqua Management Systems (Pty) Ltd, represented by Mr Bok, was in fact the entity that occupied the property. Mr Bok pleaded that Aqua occupied the property at all relevant times. In their pleas both defendants explained their relationship with Aqua. The introduction of Aqua in the defendants’ pleas caused the plaintiff to deliver a notice of intention to amend its particulars of claim by substituting Aqua, represented by Mr Bok as its sole director, for Mr Bok in his personal capacity, and pleading that Wild Coast and Aqua operated a joint venture, alternatively a partnership on the property. This was met by a notice in terms of rule 30(2)(b), in which Wild Coast contended that the notice of intention to amend was an irregular step. The plaintiff disregarded the notice and delivered the amended pages. Aqua thereupon brought its rule 30 application on the basis that the substitution of one party with another could not take place by notice. In distinguishing the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in the Mtokwana case, the High Court held that although the plaintiff in effect substituted Mr Bok with Aqua, it could do so by means of an amendment: ‘[34] I find that in this case it is appropriate to utilize rule 28 in the substitution of a wrong defendant, because Aqua, is represented in the action by Bok, its representative or agent and by Wild Coast, its co-partner. Therefore, service of the notice of amendment on Bok which clearly demonstrated that he was going to be replaced by Aqua was adequate in the light of the obligations that he, as a sole director has towards Aqua. In any event, from the pleadings it appears that the basis of the claim against him arose from the relationship that he had with Aqua as its representative. No incurable injustice would result, in my view. The facts of this case are distinguishable from those that applied in MEC for Safety and Security, EC v Mtokwana [Author’s note: The correct reference is MEC for Safety and Security, Eastern Cape v",
