The marriage was one under Islamic law and was not registered under the Marriage Act 25 of 1961. In the divorce action the wife sought, inter alia, recognition of the validity of the marriage under the Marriage Act 25 of 1961. The husband objected in limine, arguing that no marriage existed and that rule 43 accordingly did not apply. His grounds for so arguing were that he had already terminated the marriage by pronouncing a Talaq (i e divorce) and that the 32 marriage according to Islamic law was not valid in terms of the Marriage Act 25 of 1961. The court held that it was unnecessary for the applicant in a rule 43 application to prove prima facie the validity of the marriage. The entitlement to maintenance pendente lite arose from the general duty of the husband to support his wife and children. Accordingly, the wife could not be precluded from obtaining relief in terms of rule 43 by virtue of a Muslim marriage, irrespective of whether the husband had pronounced a Talaq or not.",

A court dealing with an application under this subrule should be satisfied that major children of the marriage who are still financially dependent on the spouses are properly provided 39 for. It has been held that a dependent major child retains locus standi in rule 43 maintenance claims on such child’s behalf and must be joined (or must at the very least file a confirmatory affidavit) in the proceedings. This would ensure that the child’s financial needs are squarely before the court and protect children from having to bring discrete maintenance claims against their parents. Failure to join the child could negatively affect the applicant’s claim in respect of the child. 40 It has been said that a claim supported by reasonable and moderate details carries more weight than one which includes extravagant or extortionate demands. Similarly, more weight will be attached to the affidavit of a respondent who evinces a 41 willingness to implement his lawful obligations than to that of one who is seeking to evade them. The court usually orders periodic payments of money but may order that other assets (such as furniture) be made available 42 43 for use by the applicant. The court has no jurisdiction under this subrule to award lump sum payments. Under a writ of execution issued in the High Court pursuant to an order in terms of this subrule, a pension benefit falling 44 under the Pension Funds Act 24 of 1956 can be attached. A maintenance court has in terms of s 16(1)(b) of the Maintenance Act 99 of 1998 jurisdiction to substitute or discharge an 45 order for the payment of maintenance pendente lite made under this subrule. The maintenance court, however, has to display caution in such circumstances and not lightly change an order made in terms of rule 43 in the absence of altered 46 circumstances.",

The right to dignity in s 10 of the Constitution is also impacted when a spouse is deprived of the necessary means to litigate. A person’s dignity is impaired when she has to go cap in hand to family or friends to borrow funds for legal costs, or forced to be beholden to an attorney who is willing to wait for payment of fees — in effect to act as her 56 ‘banker’. The cases are not harmonious on the question whether a court may order a contribution to legal costs that have already 57 59 58 In AF v MF been incurred. Davis AJ, after an analysis of the different approaches and relevant principles, convincingly concluded that past legal costs, including debts incurred to fund legal costs, could be taken into account in the assessment of an appropriate contribution towards costs in terms of rule 43(1)(b), at least to the extent that the court considers the past 60 62 61 In A.L.G v L.L.G expenditure to be reasonable. Binns-Ward J held that rule 43 fell to be construed and applied in the context of the modern legal environment and, accordingly, could not conceive why there should be any obstacle to the making of an order for a contribution towards costs that included costs already incurred. The cases are also not harmonious on the question whether a court may order a contribution towards the costs of interim applications in the principal divorce proceedings. On the one hand, it has been held that the costs of such applications are 63 excluded from the operation of this subrule. On the other hand, and this seems to be the preferable approach, it has been held that such costs are included under the subrule, provided that they relate to applications which are truly interlocutory to 64 the principal divorce proceedings.",

The court’s power to make orders for a contribution towards costs is a power which vests in it by virtue of substantive law, i e the common law. It is a power that was exercised for many decades before rule 43 was introduced. Rule 43 only regulates procedure, and if it were abolished, the substantive power would not disappear.
