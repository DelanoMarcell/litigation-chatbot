In my opinion, however, there is no rational basis for excluding such a case from the scope of rule 31. The relevant parts of the rule were no doubt drafted on the assumption that, in the case of a debt or liquidated demand, the plaintiff would follow the less expensive procedure laid down in rule 31(5). But where, on such a claim, default judgment is instead granted by the court, there is no reason to deprive a defendant of the benefit of rule 31(2)(b) and, conversely, there is no reason why such a defendant should not be bound by the 20-day time limit specified in rules 31(2)(b), as would have the been position in terms of 31(5)(d), had the default judgment been granted by the registrar. Reading rule 31 purposively, I consider it to be necessarily implied that rule 31(2)(b) applies where, for any reason, the court rather than the registrar has granted default judgment on a claim for a debt or liquidated demand.’",

It was held that it is undesirable, impractical and contrary to the interests of justice to combine a judgment by confession with an application to declare an immovable residential property executable in compliance with the requirements of rule 46A. This is so because service of the application for judgment by confession would not inform the defendants, as lay persons, how they should go about placing before the judge in chambers any facts or representations regarding the fate of the residential property.

In Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran v Berends 63 it was held that the subrule requires no more than that the application be lodged with the registrar and served on the respondent within the prescribed period on the ground that (a) there is a preponderance of authority that expressions such as ‘application shall be made’ should be interpreted as meaning that the application must be filed with the registrar and served on the 64 respondent within the prescribed period, and (b) to hold otherwise would not only defeat the underlying purpose of the 65 subrule, but would also be harsh, unjust, unreasonable and absurd.",

In circumstances where the credit provider alleged that the agreement had been cancelled at the issue of the s 129 notice, but continued to receive payments, more was expected in the report to the court considering judgment by default. Where the consumer made payments, believing those were payments in fulfilment of the agreement, when the agreement had been cancelled and such cancellation was known only to the creditor, such receipt seemed to be a receipt under false pretences. Mitigation of damages and transparency, especially a frank and candid disclosure to a court called upon to determine the request for default judgment, were not mutually exclusive. Courts should ensure that the bad tendencies, practices and cultures in debt recovery, especially hasty and unnecessary dispossession of properties which were subject to credit agreements, did not remain a living, stubborn heritage in the history of consumer credit, when considering, especially, 113 judgment by default.",

The court found that the clauses did not operate to deprive the plaintiff of the right to institute proceedings in the High Court for a claim for relief arising out of cancelled instalment sale agreements even though the value of the contract might fall within the monetary jurisdiction of the magistrate’s court and, accordingly, that the registrar erred in refusing, in terms of rule 31(5)(b)(iii) of the Uniform Rules of Court, to grant default judgment on the ground that the High Court lacked jurisdiction.

I associate myself fully with the reasoning of Van Oosten Jin that matter and particularly with the quotation from Standard Credit Corporation Ltd v Bester and Others to the following effect: “. .. courts should be extremely wary of closing their doors to any litigant entitled to approach a particular court. The doors of court should at all times be open to litigants falling within their jurisdiction. If congested rolls tend to hamper the proper functioning of a court then a solution should be found elsewhere, but not by refusing to hear a litigant or to entertain proceedings in a matter within a court’s jurisdiction and properly before the court.”",

That directive obviously does not apply to applications for default judgment brought before that date. Counsel acting for Firstrand Bank Ltd raised the question of the legality of such a practice directive contending that it may well be ultra vires inasmuch as it is at variance with the provisions of sec 21 of the Superior Courts Act, 10 of 2013. Section 21(1) provides that Divisions of the High Court have jurisdiction “over all persons residing or being in, and in relation to all causes arising in . . . within its area of jurisdiction”.",

It was held in Dorfling v Coetzee 1979 (2) SA 632 (NC) that in motor collision cases the evidence should not be confined to the quantum of damage suffered but should also establish the cause of action, whether there has been contributory negligence and whether there should be an apportionment. The practice in this respect is, however, not uniform. In Venter v Nel 1997 (4) SA 1014 (N) at 1016A it was, for example, pointed out that the practice in that division is to hear some evidence on claims for damages but that the inquiry is not as detailed or controversial as it would be were the matter defended.",

In the latter case the court stated (at 575G–576C): ‘I may add to this principle that judgment by default is inherently contrary to the provisions of s 34 of the Constitution. The section provides that everyone has a right to have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public hearing before a court, or, where appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or forum. Therefore, in my view, in weighing up facts for decision, the court must on the one hand balance the need of an individual who is entitled to have access to court, and to have his or her dispute resolved in a fair public hearing, against those facts which led to the default judgment being granted in the first instance. In its deliberation the court will no doubt be mindful, especially when assessing the requirement of reasonable cause being shown, that while this requirement incorporates, among others, showing the existence of a bona fide defence, the court is not seized with the duty to evaluate the merits of such defence. The fact that the court may be in doubt about the prospects of the defence to be advanced, is not a good reason why the application should not be granted. That said however, the nature of the defence advanced must not be such that it prima facie amounts to nothing more",

In respect of matters falling under the National Credit Act 34 of 2005, the magistrate’s court has an unlimited jurisdiction by virtue of the provisions of s 172(2) of the National Credit Act and s 29(1)(e) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 32 of 1944. This was recognized by the full court (at 284A–B). There is, therefore, no monetary limit which could, as in the cases setting the general principle in respect of the risk of costs being granted only on a magistrate’s court scale, activate that risk. Simply put, the general principle does not seem to apply in actions falling under the National Credit Act 34 of 2005.",
