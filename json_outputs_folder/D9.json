First it must decide whether it is just and equitable to grant an eviction order having regard to all relevant factors. Under s 4(7) those factors include the availability of alternative land or accommodation. The weight to be attached to that factor must be assessed in the light of the property owner’s protected rights under s 25 of the Constitution, and on the footing that a limitation of those rights in favour of the occupiers will ordinarily be limited in duration. Once the court decides that there is no defence to the claim for eviction and that it would be just and equitable to grant an eviction order, it is obliged to grant that order. Before doing so, however, it must consider what justice and equity demand in relation to the date of implementation of that order and it must consider what conditions must be attached to that order. In that second enquiry it must consider the impact of an eviction order on the occupiers and whether they may be rendered homeless thereby or need emergency assistance to relocate elsewhere. The order that it grants as a result of those two discrete enquiries is a single order. Accordingly it cannot be granted until both enquiries have been undertaken and the",

The mandament van spolie cannot be used to circumvent the protection given to occupiers of homes by PIE (City of Cape Town v Rudolph 2004 (5) SA 39 (C) at 61E). Although PIE might prevent the use of the mandament van spolie to evict a person from his home, such prevention cannot occur if PIE is not applicable due to the fact that the person sought to be evicted has for a considerable period of time not occupied the dwelling on a regular basis or with any degree of permanence and where it could, accordingly, be said that the dwelling is not such person’s fixed residence or seat of domestic life (Afzal v Kalim 2013 (6) SA 176 (ECP) at 181F–182E and 183C–184G).

Steenberg Project in the Western Cape was one such development. The applicant was accredited as a social housing institution pursuant to the provisions of the Social Housing Act 16 of 2008. It had concluded a lease agreement with the City of Cape Town (the registered owner of the land upon which the project was built), at a time when the land was undeveloped. Funding for the construction of the immovable properties on the land was provided from National Government, with a provincial top-up, as well as significant loan funding sourced and utilized by the applicant itself. The court held that the applicant was therefore entitled to launch the application for eviction of the unlawful occupiers by reason of it having been the person in charge of the Steenberg Project, as envisaged in s 1 of PIE. In addition it was held that, by reason of the lease agreement concluded between the applicant and the City, the applicant was the person who at all relevant times had the necessary legal authority to give permission to persons to enter upon or reside upon the land in question (at paragraph 25).",

In Okkupeerders van die Plaas Rietfontein v Mooikloof Estates (Edms) Bpk (unreported, TPD case no 5496/99 dated 5 June 1999) it was held that the phrase ‘the court must serve written and effective notice of the proceedings’ in s 4(2) merely meant that the summons or application had to be served upon 14 days’ notice to the unlawful occupier and municipality having jurisdiction. In Cape Killarney Property Investments (Pty) Ltd v Mahamba 2001 (4) SA 1222 (SCA) it was, however, held (at 1227F–H) that these words were intended to mean that the contents and the manner of service of the notice in terms of s 4(2) must be authorized and directed by an order of the court concerned. It was held, further (at 1227H–J), that in addition to the notice in terms of s 4(2), a notice in terms of s 4(3) must be served in accordance with the rules of the court in question. It was held (at 1228B–D) that in High Court proceedings the s 4(2) notice can be directed and authorized by the court only after all the papers on both sides have been served. The approach in Cape Killarney was followed and applied in PZL Properties (Pty) Limited v Unlawful Occupiers of Erf […] Judith’s Paarl Township (unreported, GJ case no 053569/2022 dated 30 January 2023) at paragraphs 21–25; and see Kgwete v Makonko (unreported, GJ case no 2022/010418 dated 8 August 2023) at paragraph [13]. In Thiam v Magee Investments CC t/a Magee Property Investment (unreported, CPD case no A516 (2007)), followed in Theart v Minnaar NO 2009 (3) SA 503 (C) at 505E–F, the full court expressed the view that the dictum in the Cape Killarney case should not be regarded as imposing a requirement of substantive law in all eviction proceedings, nor should it be applied to such proceedings other than those initiated by way of notice of motion in the High Court. In Ansie Senekal v Winskor 174 (Pty) Ltd (unreported, CPD case no A722/2007 dated 23 July 2008), referred to in the Theart case at 508F–J, it was pointed out that there is nothing in PIE that prohibits a notice of motion from containing the ‘notice of the proceedings’ and directions for its service in combination with the application for ejectment of the unlawful occupier. In the Theart case it was pointed out (at 505H–I) that the authorization of the s 4(2) notice by the court may be effected ex parte. See also Theart v Minnaar NO; Senekal v Winskor 174 (Pty) Ltd 2010 (3) SA 327 (SCA) in which the appeals in the Theart and Senekal cases were dismissed.",

The answer must depend on what the respondents already knew. The appellant’s contention to the contrary cannot be sustained. It would lead to results which are untenable. Take the example of a s 4(2) notice which failed to comply with s 4(5)(d) in that it did not inform the respondents that they were entitled to defend a case or of their right to legal aid. What would be the position if all this were clearly spelt out in the application papers? Or if on the day of the hearing the respondents appeared with their legal aid attorney? Could it be suggested that in these circumstances the s 4(2) should still be regarded as fatally defective? I think not. In this case, both the municipality’s cause of action and the facts upon which it relied appeared from the founding papers. The appellants accepted that this is so. If not, it would constitute a separate defence. When the respondents received the s 4(2) notice they therefore already knew what case they had to meet. In these circumstances it must, in my view, be held that, despite its stated defects, the s 4(2) notice served upon the respondents had substantially complied with the requirements of s 4(5).’",

There is no general duty on a municipality to report in all cases. Each case will have to be approached in view of its own facts (see City of Johannesburg v Changing Tides 74 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (6) SA 294 (SCA) at 317D–H; Vincemus Investments (Pty) Ltd t/a Ponte City v Sindi (unreported, GJ case no 26720/2019 dated 13 September 2021) at paragraph [22]). In case of doubt a municipality would probably be well advised to file a report (Drakenstein Municipality v Hendricks 2010 (3) SA 248 (WCC) at 260G–262E); but see Cashbuild (South Africa) (Pty) Ltd v Scott 2007 (1) SA 332 (T) at 338E–H and 339E–340I; Oelofsen NO v Gwebu 2010 (5) SA 241 (GNP) at 251B–C and 251I–252B. Reports by municipalities are, however, the norm and not the exception; it has been held that failure of municipalities to report to the court would hamper the court’s ability to make decisions that are truly just and equitable (ABSA Bank Ltd v Murray 2004 (2) SA 15 (C) at 30B–G; Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd v Occupiers of Saratoga Avenue 2009 (1) SA 470 (W) at 480H–481D; and see Cashbuild (South Africa) (Pty) Ltd v Scott 2007 (1) SA 332 (T) at 338E–H and 339E–340I); Arendse v Communicare NPC (unreported, WCC case no A76/2023 dated 25 March 2024) at paragraphs [38]–[47] (a case where a report was warranted but not obtained). The report of the municipality should set out its current housing policy and, in addition, deal directly with the facts of the particular case (City of Johannesburg v Changing Tides 74 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (6) SA 294 (SCA) at 318E).

In Johannesburg City v K2016498847 (Pty) Ltd 2022 (3) SA 497 (GJ) the Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality (‘the City’) sought an order for an interdict restraining the respondent company from using a certain property as an ‘accommodation establishment’ (i e letting it out to multiple households), such use being contrary to the way the property was zoned under the applicable Land Use Scheme, i e ‘Residential 1’, and to forthwith use the property in a zone-compliant manner. The City sought further relief: that, should the respondent not comply, the sheriff be authorized to take all necessary steps to give effect to the interdict, including taking into possession ‘all that [was] found at the property’ and to keep such items that the company was using to conduct an accommodation establishment, pending payment of the City’s ‘reasonable fees and disbursements’ incurred in the execution of the order. The High Court observed (without deciding the issue) that s 6 of PIE empowers a municipality to seek the eviction of people who are living in structures erected without its consent, or where it is otherwise in the public interest to evict a person or persons, but that s 6 makes it clear that a municipality may only evict ‘unlawful occupiers’ in these circumstances. On the face of it, then, s 6 of PIE does not apply where a municipality seeks to enforce its Land Use Scheme against individuals who are living on property in breach of that Scheme but with the permission of the owner or the person in charge (at paragraphs [27]–[33]).",

The court must exercise a judicial discretion which obliges the court to strike a balance between the proprietary rights of the owner and the basic human rights of the occupier (ABSA Bank Ltd v Murray 2004 (2) SA 15 (C) at 21C–G; Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers 2005 (1) SA 217 (CC) at 224H, 229F–G and 236E; Jackpersad NO v Mitha 2008 (4) SA 522 (D) at 529D–E; Grobler v Phillips 2023 (1) SA 321 (CC) at paragraphs [36]–[48]). In order to ensure that it is adequately informed in regard to the relevant factors that must be taken into account in making a decision, a court could take a proactive approach and make use, where appropriate, of court-ordered mediation or engagement, or structured interdicts. Such more active role in managing the litigation does not, however, permit the court to enter the arena or take over the running of litigation (City of Johannesburg v Changing Tides 74 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (6) SA 294 (SCA) at 312D–313D).

Cases where that onus affects the outcome are likely to be few and far between because the court will ordinarily be able to make the value judgment involved on the material before it. However, the fact that an applicant bears the onus of satisfying the court on this question means that it has a duty to place evidence before the court in its founding affidavits that will be sufficient to discharge that onus in the light of the court’s obligation to have regard to all relevant factors. The City’s contention, that the common-law position continues to prevail and that it is for the occupiers to place the relevant facts before the court, is incorrect. Once that is recognised it should mean that applicants go to greater lengths to place evidence of relevant facts before the court from the outset, and this will expedite the process of disposing of these applications, particularly in cases that are unopposed, as the need for the court to direct that further information be obtained will diminish.’",

In Mayekiso v Patel 2019 (2) SA 522 (WCC) Gamble J, writing for the majority, emphasized the competing constitutionally entrenched rights at play under PIE, namely s 26(3), which provides that people may not be evicted from their homes without an order of court granted after consideration of all the relevant circumstances, and s 25(1), which protects the rights of owners of private property against arbitrary expropriation (at paragraphs [58] and [59]), referred to in Rantsoareng N.O. v Titus (unreported, FB case no 3943/2022 dated 11 November 2022) at paragraph [13]. See also GA-Segonyana Local Municipality v All Unidentified and Unknown Persons Occupying or Intending to Unlawfully Occupy ERF [. . .] Kuruman (unreported, NCK case no 1773/2021 dated 16 September 2022) at paragraph [18]. If there is a threat of lawlessness should an applicant evict illegal occupiers from its land, the State has a duty to uphold the rule of law. If the municipality concerned has a lack of funds to protect the rights of the applicant and the illegal occupiers, the provincial government and the Government, as higher echelons of the State, have a direct and substantial interest in the final outcome of the case and could be joined as respondents (Chieftain Real Estate Incorporated in Ireland v Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality 2008 (5) SA 387 (T) at 392J–393B); but see City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd 2011 (4) SA 337 (SCA) at 359C. Consent in eviction proceedings is a valid defence (Davidan v Polovin NO [2021] 4 All SA 37 (SCA) at paragraph [12]). It has been held by the Constitutional Court that the duties of a court when dealing with proceedings for eviction from residences generally, and when faced with actual or purported consent to eviction, arose from the protection of the rights of residents and were therefore inextricably intertwined with the issue of informed consent and waiver. The court must as a first step be satisfied that the parties freely, voluntarily and with full knowledge of their rights agreed to the eviction. A consent to an eviction order would entail the waiver of, at a minimum, the following: the constitutional and statutory rights to eviction only after a court has considered all the relevant circumstances (s 26(3) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996); to the joinder of the local authority and production by it of a report on the need and availability of alternative accommodation; to a just and equitable order in terms of s 4(6)–(7) and s 6(1) of PIE; and to temporary alternative accommodation in the event that eviction would result in homelessness. If these rights were capable of waiver, such waiver would need to be free, voluntary and informed. If the factual consent was not informed it would be legally invalid, and so not binding on them (Occupiers, Berea v De Wet NO 2017 (5) SA 346 (CC) at 356D–E, 357F–358F, 359A–C and 366A–C). 44 President of the Republic of South Africa v Modderklip Boerdery (Pty) Ltd 2004 (6) SA 40 (SCA) at 61H. See, further, Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers 2005 (1) SA 217 (CC) at 236C–242F; Transnet Ltd v Nyawuza 2006 (5) SA 100 (D) at 105G–107D. 45 Occupiers, Berea v De Wet NO 2017 (5) SA 346 (CC) at 362G–364A. 46 This refers to a defence that would entitle the occupier to remain in occupation as against the owner of the property, such as the existence of a valid lease (City of Johannesburg v Changing Tides 74 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (6) SA 294 (SCA) at 304H). In Magic Vending (Pty) Ltd v Tambwe 2021 (2) SA 512 (WCC) the applicant, in an application for eviction under PIE, invoked a forfeiture clause for the summary cancellation of a lease due to non-payment of rental by the first respondent. The latter raised, amongst other things, the defence that the forfeiture clause constituted an ‘unfair, unreasonable or unjust term’ as contemplated in s 48 of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008. The court, in rejecting the defence, held that the contextual indications of what the legislature contemplated by a term that might be ‘unfair’, suggested that it would be one that was exploitative of the consumer. The provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 should not be construed so as to purport to invest in the courts a power to refuse to enforce contractual terms on the basis that their enforcement would, in the judge’s subjective view, be unfair, unreasonable or unduly harsh; they should rather be construed as, in certain respects, codifying the established principle that courts will refuse to enforce contractual provisions that are so unfair, unreasonable or unjust that it would be contrary to public policy to give effect to them (at paragraph [7]). The court held, further, that forfeiture clauses were common features of lease agreements and that there was nothing lacking in good faith about their incorporation. Had it been the legislative intention to override the rich body of jurisprudence that has held them to be enforceable according to their tenor and that the courts have no equitable jurisdiction to relieve a debtor from the effect of them, the statute would have provided as much unequivocally (at paragraph [8]). In Nelson v Samuels [2021] 3 All SA 190 (WCC) the court rejected a defence based on some form of entitlement to the property concerned under Islamic law and held that the opposition by the respondents to the eviction application was brazen, uncompromising and demonstrative of an attitude tantamount to expropriation (at paragraph 36). In Gefen v De Wet NO 2022 (3) SA 465 (GJ) the respondents raised a defence to an eviction application in their answering affidavit but subsequently failed to comply with a compelling order to file heads and a practice note in the application. The court a quo accordingly granted an order striking out the respondents’ defence and granted an eviction order. In an appeal lodged by the respondents against the order, the full court, in setting aside the order, held that: (i) before granting the striking-out of the defence application, the court a quo should not only have considered whether a proper explanation had been furnished for non-compliance with the compelling order to file heads and a practice note but in addition should have broadly considered the veracity of all possible defences which would have informed the court about the possibility of a successful defence against an eviction, and whether these defences had been raised in a bona fide manner (at paragraph [26]); (ii) a striking-out of a defence was a drastic remedy and, accordingly, the court should be apprised of sufficient facts on the basis of which it could exercise its discretion in favour of such an order (at paragraph [27]); (iii) in an eviction application, having regard to the provisions of s 4(7), the enquiry extended even wider. A court granting an eviction application had to consider whether it would be just and equitable to evict an occupier from his residence despite a finding that the occupier was unlawfully occupying the land or premises in question. The court had to act proactively to obtain as much information as possible. More so as the prejudice a party might suffer if the order was made or not had to be considered. A judicial discretion could only be exercised if it was a properly informed decision. To be in that position it would not be helpful to strike a defence and the facts supporting the defence which were contained in an answering affidavit (at paragraph [30]); (iv) there was no indication that the court a quo had considered the impact which s 4(7) could have had on the order to strike the defence or to evict the respondents. The court a quo had not considered the veracity of the defence raised by the respondents, which should have included an enquiry whether it would have been just and equitable to evict them. Consequently, the court a quo had not exercised its discretion judicially in granting the application to strike out the defence, as well as to grant the eviction order (at paragraph [32]). 47 See, for example, City of Johannesburg v Changing Tides 74 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (6) SA 294 (SCA) at 304; Miya v Matleko-Seifert 2023 (1) SA 208 (GJ) (a decision of the full bench) at paragraph [36]; Jacobs N.O. v Nakedi (unreported, FB case no 4648/2023 dated 30 January 2024) at paragraph [30]. 48 City of Johannesburg v Changing Tides 74 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (6) SA 294 (SCA) at 304E; Johannesburg Housing Corporation (Pty) Ltd v Unlawful Occupiers Newtown Urban Village 2013 (1) SA 583 (GSJ) at 592E–F and 595D–F; Vincemus Investments (Pty) Ltd t/a Ponte City v Sindi (unreported, GJ case no 26720/2019 dated 13 September 2021) at paragraph [10]; Super Four Developers CC v Mallick (unreported, EP case no 1570/2020 dated 4 October 2021) at paragraph [25]; GA-Segonyana Local Municipality v All Unidentified and Unknown Persons Occupying or Intending to Unlawfully Occupy ERF [. . .] Kuruman (unreported, NCK case no 1773/2021 dated 16 September 2022) at paragraphs [29]–[30]; Goodfind Properties (Pty) Ltd v Adriaanse and Similar Cases (unreported, WCC case no 6635/2022 dated 28 November 2022) at paragraph [23]; Blue Dot Properties 391 (Pty) Ltd v H.G (unreported, WCC case no 1926/2023 dated 1 November 2023) at paragraphs 23–28; Jacobs N.O. v Nakedi (unreported, FB case no 4648/2023 dated 30 January 2024) at paragraph [31]. 49 City of Johannesburg v Changing Tides 74 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (6) SA 294 (SCA) at 304D–E; Vincemus Investments (Pty) Ltd t/a Ponte City v Sindi (unreported, GJ case no 26720/2019 dated 13 September 2021) at paragraph [22]; Super Four Developers CC v Mallick (unreported, EP case no 1570/2020 dated 4 October 2021) at paragraphs [25]–[26]; City of Cape Town v Various Occupiers [2024] 3 All SA 428 (WCC) at paragraph [265]; Okoye v Lockyer (unreported, GJ case no 2022/43051 dated 9 July 2024) at paragraph [26]; De Kock v Du Plessis (unreported, SCA case no 284/2023 dated 24 July 2024) at paragraph [53]. 50 City of Johannesburg v Changing Tides 74 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (6) SA 294 (SCA) at 305B; Chapelgate Properties 1022 CC v Unlawful Occupiers of Erf 644 Kew 2017 (1) SA 403 (GJ) at 428D–431H.

As to unoccupied structures, the City asserted that neither PIE nor the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, required eviction or demolition to be in terms of a court order (at paragraph [40]). The court, however, concluded that judicial supervision was justified (at paragraphs [54]–[55]). This in a context where City officials decided whether structures were unoccupied and where such decisions were sometimes arbitrary, with officials making the decisions in their own cause, without public hearing, and unguided by rules, legislation or policy, and where PIE, properly interpreted, required supervision in cases of doubt (at paragraphs [46.4], [47], [50] and [52]).",
