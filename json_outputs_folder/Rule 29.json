In Natal Joint Municipal Pension Fund v 4 5 Endumeni Municipality the Supreme Court of Appeal pointed out that there was no problem with the formulation that the effect of litis contestatio is to ‘freeze the plaintiff’s rights as at that moment’ when parties abided by their pleadings and conducted the trial accordingly. Frequently, however, parties did not do so because other issues arose that they wished to canvass, and, either formally, by way of an amendment to pleadings, or informally, they altered the scope of the 6 7 litigation. The effect of this was stated by the Supreme Court of Appeal to be the following (per Wallis JA):",
