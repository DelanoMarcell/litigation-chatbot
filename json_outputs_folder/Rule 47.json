The omission of a similar provision to s 13 from the 2008 Act must therefore be taken (prima facie at least) to import a change of intention on the part of the legislature. It must therefore follow that it is not open to a court to approach an enquiry such as this as if the position were unaltered and that s 13 is still part of our law. For to do so may well result in a court impermissibly intruding into the domain of the legislature. Third, it has been suggested that such a provision has been excluded because its inclusion would limit the fundamental right of access to the courts as enshrined in s 34 of the Constitution and would thereby be unconstitutional. But that may be to ignore the fact that a court was vested with a discretion in terms of s 13 and that in exercising its discretion a court performs a balancing act. On the one hand it must weigh the injustice to the plaintiff if prevented from pursuing a proper claim by an order for security, and against that it must weigh the injustice to the defendant if no security is ordered and the plaintiff’s claim fails and the former finds himself or herself unable to recover costs. Significantly, on that score the European Court of Human Rights appears to have inclined to the view that security for costs pursued a legitimate aim, namely to protect a litigant from being faced with an",

    "text": "irrecoverable bill for legal costs, and since regard was had to prospects of success the requirement could be said to have been imposed in the interests of the fair administration of justice. It is also noteworthy that back home, as long ago as Lombard it was stated by Bristowe J that the power to order security for costs is a most reasonable one. Why the legislature saw fit to exclude it (or a provision that mirrors it) is fortunately a debate that is not necessary for us to enter. Fourth, s 39(2) of the Constitution makes plain that, when a court embarks upon a course of developing the common law, it is obliged to “promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights”. This ensures that the common law will evolve, within the framework of the Constitution, consistently with the basic norms of the legal order that it establishes. Faced with such a task, a court is obliged to undertake a two-stage enquiry. It should ask itself whether, given the objectives of s 39(2), the existing common law should be developed beyond existing precedent — if the answer to that question were in the negative, that should be the end of the enquiry. If not, the next enquiry should be how the development should occur and which court should embark on that exercise. Fifth, the omission of a provision akin to s 13 from the new Act is strange, particularly since s 8 of the Close Corporations Act 69 of 1984, which has been interpreted in accordance with the principles that have evolved in relation to the corresponding provisions in the previous Companies Act, has been retained. It follows that the principles pertaining to the furnishing of security by a close corporation will henceforth differ from that applicable to a company. Such incongruity as may arise from that dichotomy is no invitation to a court to continue to approach an enquiry such as this in relation to a company as if s 13 were still in force.",

The discretion contained in s 13 was to be exercised upon a 64 consideration of all the relevant features, without any predisposition for the granting of security. In the exercise of its discretion the court had regard to the nature of the claim, the financial position of the company at the stage of the application for security, and its probable financial position if it should lose the action; a full enquiry into the 65 merits of the contemplated litigation was not required, save, possibly, if it was apparent that the plaintiff’s 66 action was not bona fide or was vexatious or hopeless. The court also had regard to the plaintiff’s attempt to find financial assistance from its shareholders and creditors or other affiliates, backers or interested persons 67 because they were the ultimate beneficiaries of a successful action.

It would therefore not be appropriate for an appellate court to interfere with an order for security for costs made under s 8 of the Close Corporations Act 69 of 1984 as long as it was judicially made, on the basis of the correct facts and legal principles. If the court took into account irrelevant considerations, or bases the exercise of its discretion on wrong legal principles, its judgment could be overturned on appeal. Beyond that, however, the decision of the court of first instance would be unassailable. 115",

There being no demonstrable misdirection in its reasoning, such leave should never have been granted. In the event that leave was warranted, there still is no reason why the matter could not have been dealt with by the full court in terms of s 20(2) of the Supreme Court Act 59 of 1959. The principles governing applications of this nature, which present no complexities, are by now settled as evidenced by the cases cited above. This court has previously remonstrated against appeals against security orders being brought to it, at great expense to the litigants and to the detriment of difficult cases more deserving of its attention. It is hoped that litigants and the High Courts will heed this concern.’",

In Magida v Minister of Police 1987 (1) SA 1 (A) it is said (at 13J–14A) that normally the application should be brought before litis contestatio. In Exploitatie- en Beleggingsmaatschappij Argonauten 11 BV v Honig 2012 (1) SA 247 (SCA) it was held (at 253A–B) that while, as a general rule, a party was expected to apply expeditiously for security under rule 47, a party was entitled to seek additional security at any stage, although an unreasonable delay in doing so might be decisive in the exercise of the court’s discretion. It was therefore wrong to allege that the party might not apply for security for costs at a late stage of the proceedings.
